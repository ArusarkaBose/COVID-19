The differential signal intensity between the perfectly matched probe and mismatched probes allows the base to be determined precisely. These resequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each BCG strain and scanned as above. Sequence base assignments were made using a machinelearning algorithm [76] . Putative mutation-containing DNA segments were PCR amplified and verified by capillary sequencing [see Additional file 3]. The microarray data has been deposited in the Center for Information Biology Gene Expression Database (CIBEX; http:// cibex.nig.ac.jp), with the accession number of CBX70.ASL, VT, ZW, and XY performed the experiments and participated in data analysis.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the MERS crisis was a 'wakeup call.

Highly useful information is well organized and ready to be used in the US-CDC [6] , so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. All we need is to find a conduit for connection. For example, the task of disease surveillance for MERS is relatively small compared to NEDSS.

Indeed, recombinant viruses lacking orf5 expression replicated to high titers (44). Similarly, Almazan et al observed that virus titers, cpe and plaque morphology of MERS-delta5 are similar to that of parental virus. In the case of MERS-delta4ab the viral titer was only 10 fold lower at 72hpi. How the authors explain this discrepancy? This can be related to an improper way to quantify viral production. Usually viral titers are determined by plaque assay (pfu/ml) in growth kinetics at different times of infection. In this study, they use RT-PCR in supernatant to detect viral genome but this experiment does not measure viral infectivity. However, no quantification of LC3-II/LC3-I is available and the expression level of LC3-I seems important compared to other WB of the article.Panel B and C: How is the multiplication of these mutant viruses in autophagy deficient cells?

This suggests that of the activities potentially elicited by enhancing BECN1 protein levels it is autophagy that is relevant, but it does not prove it.

Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1.

An initial concern for this figure is that ectopic TRAF6 was not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. The authors have now added in the data showing TRAF6 ectopically expressed in this experiment. The text states, as well as the graph of the western blots, that TRAF6 ectopically expressed in the cells does not effect Beclin 1 levels. However the western blots associated with Figure 2E clearly show a stabilizing effect on Beclin1 protein levels, which does not correlate with the graph shown in Figure 2F . There does not seem to be a way to connect the western blot data with that graphed in Figure 2F .

Health care workers (HCW) are at increased risk for COVID-19 because upper GI endoscopy is a high-risk aerosol-generating procedure, 2 and oral-fecal transmission might be a potential route for COVID-19. 3 Recommendations have been changing rapidly and need to be updated, mainly because we are facing a scenario of sustained community transmission of COVID-19 worldwide. 4 To conduct an overview of the recommendations for endoscopic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, we assessed electronic sites of international/national societies of gastroenterology/gastrointestinal endoscopy to review the current recommendations up to March 27, 2020. Overall, 93 international/national societies were identified, and 21 of them have elaborated specific recommendations for endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic (supplementary material available upon request).

There was not any mention of using pre-or postexposure prophylaxis for HCW. All international societies recommended following a standardized reprocessing procedure for flexible endoscopes.In summary, we validated the recommendations for endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic described by our colleagues based on an extensive and updated review of statements of international and national societies of gastroenterology/gastrointestinal endoscopy worldwide. The situation is rapidly evolving, and this guidance might be updated regularly.

Transverse images for fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T2*W, T1-weighted before and after intravenous administration of contrast medium (gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg bodyweight [Gadovist;Bayer]) and proton-density weighted sequences were obtained.On all sequences there was thinning of the cerebral and cerebellar cortices with widening of the corresponding sulci, demonstrating diffuse cortical atrophy.

We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate multivariate-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of a positive Covid-19 test through April 23, 2020.Among 2,035,395 community individuals and 99,795 frontline HCWs, we documented 5,545 incident reports of a positive Covid-19 test over 34,435,273 person-days. Compared to the general community, frontline HCWs had an aHR of 11.6 (95% CI: 10 Frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of symptomatic Covid-19 infection, which was highest among HCWs with inadequate access to PPE who cared for Covid-19 patients. However, adequate supplies of PPE did not completely mitigate high-risk exposures (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04331509)..

(which was not certified by peer review)Since its emergence, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global health threat. 1 As of April 2020, over 2.8 million cases of Covid-19 have been documented worldwide with nearly 200,000 deaths. 2,3 With ongoing community transmission from asymptomatic individuals across numerous international foci, 4-8 the burden of this disease is expected to continue rising over the coming weeks. [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Consequently, there will be an ongoing need for frontline healthcare workers (HCW) in patient-facing roles. Because this work requires close personal exposure to patients with the virus, frontline HCWs are at high risk of infection, which may contribute to further spread. 13,14 Initial regional estimates suggest frontline HCWs may account for 10-20% of all diagnoses, 15-17 which may be an underestimate when compared to other developed and similarly affected nations such as Italy. 18 Based on experience with other viruses spread by respiratory droplets, the consistent use of disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical to reducing nosocomial transmission. 19, 20 Recent guidelines from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) advocate for the use of medical-grade masks and respirators at all times to deliver clinical care. 21 However, global shortages of masks, face shields, and gowns-exacerbated by surging demand and supply chain disruptions-have been documented, leading to efforts to conserve PPE through extended use or reuse and the development of sterilization protocols. [22] [23] [24] Although addressing the needs of frontline HCWs to effectively respond to the Covid-19 pandemic is a high priority, 17 there is a lack of prospective data to inform such efforts. Thus, we conducted a prospective, population-based study using a novel mobile-based application to examine the risk of testing positive for Covid-19 and/or developing symptoms associated with infection among 2,135,190 individuals in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the United States (U.S.) between March 24 and April 23, 2020..

Participants are encouraged to use the application daily, even when asymptomatic, to allow for the longitudinal, prospective collection of symptoms and Covid-19 testing results.The application was launched in the U.K. on March 24, 2020 and available in the U.S. beginning on March 29, 2020. 25 Participants were recruited through social media outreach, as well as invitations from the investigators of long-running prospective cohort studies to study volunteers (Table S1 ). At enrollment, participants provided informed consent to the use of aggregated information for research purposes and agreed to applicable privacy policies and terms of use. This study was approved by the Partners Human Research Committee (Protocol 2020P000909) and King's College London Ethics Committee (REMAS ID 18210, LRS-19/20-18210). This protocol is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04331509).The information collected through the app has been provided in detail. 25 Briefly, upon first use, participants were asked to provide baseline demographic factors and answered separate questions about a series of suspected risk factors for Covid-19 (Table S2) . On first use and upon daily reminders, participants were asked if they felt physically normal, and if not, their symptoms, including the presence of fever, fatigue, and loss of smell/taste (Table S3) . Participants were also asked if they had been tested for Covid-19 (yes/no), and if yes, the results (none, negative, pending, or positive)..

(which was not certified by peer review)The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 5, 2020. . At enrollment, individuals were asked if they worked in health care and if yes, whether they had direct patient contact. For our primary analysis, we defined frontline HCWs as participants who reported direct patient care.Among these individuals, we queried whether they had cared for suspected or documented Covid-19-infected patients and the frequency with which they used PPE (always, sometimes, never). We asked if they had enough PPE when needed, if they had to reuse PPE, or if they did not have enough because of shortages. We classified availability of PPE as adequate if they never required PPE or if they reported always having the PPE they needed (including reused PPE). We classified PPE availability as inadequate if they reported they did not have enough PPE or if it was not available. We also asked HCWs to report the site of their patient care.Follow-up time started at the time participants first reported on the app and accrued until the report of a positive Covid-19 test or the time of last data entry, whichever occurred first. We employed Cox proportional hazards modeling stratified by age, date, and country to estimate age-and multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). CI widths were not adjusted for multiplicity. A test of correlation between Schoenfeld residuals and survival time demonstrated no violation of the proportional hazards assumption. Covariates were selected a priori based on putative risk factors and included sex, history of diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, kidney disease, current smoking status (each yes/no), and body mass index (17-19.9, 20-24.9, 25-29.9 , and ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ). Missing categorical data was denoted with a missing indicator, while imputation methods for missing numerical data replaced no more than 5% with the median.Because the primary outcome (report of a positive Covid-19 test) was dependent on receiving a test, we performed several secondary analyses to ensure the robustness of our findings. First, we leveraged a symptom-based classifier developed by our group that is predictive of positive Covid testing. 26 Briefly, using logistic regression and symptoms preceding confirmatory testing, we found that loss of smell/taste, fatigue, persistent cough, and loss of appetite may predict Covid-19 positivity with high specificity (Suppl. Methods).Second, to account for country-specific predictors of obtaining testing, we performed separate inverse probability weighting (IPW) in the U.S. and the U.K. as a function of frontline HCW status and other factors, . CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 5, 2020. . such as age and symptom burden, followed by inverse probability weighted Cox proportional hazards modeling stratified by 5-year age group and date with additional adjustment for the covariates used in prior models (Suppl. Methods). In analyses limited to frontline HCWs, we examined PPE availability and contact with suspected or documented Covid-19 patients, as well as the primary site of clinical practice. Two-sided p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were performed using R 3.6.1 (Vienna, Austria).Between March 24 and April 23, 2020, we enrolled 2,810,103 users (2,790,150 in the U.K. and 195,140 in the U.S.), defined as consenting participants who provided baseline information about either feeling normal or having symptoms (Fig. S1 ). Among users, 134,885 (4.8%) reported being a frontline HCW. We found a reported prevalence of 2,747 Covid-19-positive cases per 100,000 frontline HCWs compared to 242 per 100,000 in the general community (Fig. 1A) . Higher infection rates were reported in New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana in the U.S. and in the areas around London and the Midlands in the U.K. (Fig. 1B) .After excluding 670,298 participants who had follow-up time of less than 24 hours and 4,615 who reported a baseline positive Covid-19 test, we included 2,135,190 participants in our prospective inception cohort, among whom 99,795 persons identified as frontline HCWs (Fig. S1) . In this cohort, we recorded 24.4 million entries or 11.4 logs per participant with a median follow-up of 18.9 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5.1 to 26.1). The median age was 44 years (IQR 32 to 57). Compared to the general community, frontline HCWs were more frequently female, had a slightly higher prevalence of BMI ≥ 30, were slightly more likely to smoke, and use several common medications ( Table 1 & Table S3 ). At baseline, 20.2% of frontline HCWs reported at least one symptom associated with Covid-19 infection compared to 14.4% of the general population with fatigue, loss of smell/taste, and hoarse voice being particularly more frequent (Table S4) ..

Compared with the general community, frontline HCWs had a 12-fold increase in risk of a positive test after multivariable adjustment (aHR 11.6, 95% CI: 10.9 to 12.3; Table 2 and Fig. S2) CC-BY-ND 4.0 International license It is made available under a is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted May 5, 2020. . and reused PPE were analyzed separately (data not shown Among 2,135,190 participants in the U.K. and U.S. assessed between March 24, 2020 and April 23, 2020, we found that frontline HCWs had up to a 12-fold increased risk of a positive Covid-19 test compared to members of the general community, even after accounting for other risk factors for infection. Among frontline HCWs, inadequate PPE availability was associated with a subsequent 23% increased risk of Covid-19. AlthoughHCWs caring for Covid-19 patients who reported inadequate PPE availability had the highest risk, an increased susceptibility to infection was evident even with adequate PPE. Frontline HCWs who worked in inpatient settings and nursing homes had the greatest risk.Our findings complement early data showing that nearly 20% of the currently documented cases of Covid-19 are among HCWs. Our results provide a more precise assessment of the magnitude of increased risk among HCWs compared to their surrounding communities in the initial phases of this pandemic in both the U.K. and U.S. We also offer supportive evidence that sufficient availability of PPE, including reused PPE, reduces the risk of Covid-19 infection. However, even with reportedly adequate PPE availability, HCWs who cared for patients with documented Covid-19 remained at elevated risk, highlighting the importance of ensuring not only .

PPE availability, but also appropriate usage. In addition, the apparent lack of complete protection against acquiring Covid-19 infection through adequate supplies of PPE suggests that additional risk mitigation strategies require further investigation.Our results are supported by historical data during similar infectious disease outbreaks. During the Ebola crisis, a disease with a comparable reproduction number (e.g. the R 0 measure of how many new cases can be generated from one infected individual), HCWs comprised 3.9% of all cases, an incidence 21-to-32-times greater than the general public. 27,28 During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS) epidemic, HCWs comprised 20-40% of all cases, 29-32 and inadequate PPE availability was associated with an increased risk of illness among HCWs. 32 The experience with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 reaffirmed the importance of PPE 33, 34 and also showed much higher infection rates among HCWs working in dedicated infection containment units. 35 The strengths of this study include the use of a mobile application to rapidly collect prospective data from a large multinational cohort, which offers immediately actionable risk estimates to inform the public health response to an ongoing pandemic. 36 By recruiting participants through existing cohort studies (https://www.monganinstitute.org/cope-consortium), these results also provide proof-of-concept of the feasibility of leveraging existing infrastructure and engaged participants to address a key knowledge gap.Second, we collected information from participants initially free of a positive Covid-19 test, which offered an opportunity to prospectively assess risk factors for incident symptomatic infection with minimal recall bias.Third, our study design documented initial onset of symptoms, which minimizes biases related to capturing only more severe cases through hospitalization records or death reports. Finally, we collected information on a wide range of known or suspected risk factors for Covid-19 infection which are generally not available in existing registries or population-scale surveillance efforts.We acknowledge several limitations. First, full details of some exposures were limited to ensure our survey instrument was brief, particularly for time-limited HCWs. For example, we did not ask about specific .

Second, our findings are based on self-report. Given the quickened pace of the pandemic, self-reported information was more feasible to collect. In future studies, self-reports with linkage to other sources (e.g. electronic health records) may be possible. Third, our cohort is not a random sampling of the population. Although this limitation is inherent to any study requiring voluntary provision of health information, we acknowledge that data collection through smartphone adoption has comparatively lower penetrance among certain socioeconomic groups, as well as older adults, despite being used by 81% of the U.S. adult population. 37 In future studies, we plan more targeted outreach of populations under-represented in the current cohort, as well as additional data collection instruments (e.g. web or phone surveys) that may be more accessible to certain groups. Finally, our primary outcome is based on report of a positive Covid-19 test. During the time frame of this study, this would generally reflect nasal or throat swabs, which are reasonably specific, but only modestly sensitive. 38 However, any testing misclassification should be non-differential by occupation. Our results may also reflect differences in access to testing among HCWs compared to the general community, as well as true differences in infection rates. In our secondary analyses, we also found that HCWs were at higher risk of a positive test even after adjusting for greater probability of receiving a test. Furthermore, HCWs were at higher risk of developing symptoms that predicted Covid-19, which does not reflect access to testing. Ideally, we would assess the risk of Covid-19 infection within a population which has undergone uniform screening. However, the current shortage of PCR-based testing kits does not make such an approach feasible. Future studies using serologic testing to ascertain Covid-19 infection will require additional assessment of test performance and the ability to distinguish recent or active infection from past exposure.In conclusion, within a large population-based sample of 2,135,190 individuals in the U.S. and U.K., we demonstrate a significantly increased risk of Covid-19 infection among frontline HCWs compared to the general community. This risk is greatest among individuals in direct contact with Covid-19 patients who report inadequate PPE availability, supporting the importance of providing adequate supplies. However, because infection risk remained elevated even with adequate PPE, our results suggest the need to ensure the proper use of PPE as well as adherence to other infection control measures..

The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the MERS crisis was a 'wakeup call. ' Like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and swine flu in 2009, epidemic outbreaks will continue to happen anywhere. Korea was simply unlucky. In retrospect, it is regrettable to say that we could have done much better. Scholars and colleagues in the medical informatics field should take a moment and think hard about how we can work to fight against another epidemic invasion in the future.The Ebola epidemic of 2013 is the largest such outbreak on record, influencing many nations in Africa as well as other countries [1] . The WHO expert panel has pointed out the inadequate emergency care response and has recommended more effective mechanisms for research and development. Others have strongly recommended WHO to innovate because recent Ebola outbreaks have been radically different from previous events, and they have tended to be simultaneous and parallel: 'Highly mobile populations, the spread of Ebola into densely populated cities ... made this epidemic of many outbreaks difficult to control [2] . 'Other criticisms also include outdated therapeutic protocols, irrelevant information, untimely communication, delays in decision-making due to uncoordinated leadership, unreasonable social behavior, and so on. The recom- tems. The NEDSS can be called a medical informatics leader, which provides a standardized information infrastructure with HL7, LOINC, and SNOMED-CT. Highly useful information is well organized and ready to be used in the US-CDC [6] , so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. All we need is to find a conduit for connection. For example, the task of disease surveillance for MERS is relatively small compared to NEDSS. Using the cell phone data network, we can instantly establish a real-time patient tracking system to monitor 3-tuple data (time, location, temperature) in the country. Cell phone rental can help track down suspicious foreign visitors from arrival to departure. With the support of ISO standards, global healthcare networking is not a hard nut to crack.When the MERS epidemic outbreak was on the headline news, many attempts were made to compare MERS with tuberculosis. That is, the mortality rate of MERS is far below that of tuberculosis, so it was argued that there was no need to worry about it. The point was clear, but the timing was not right. Have you ever got a thorn stuck under your fingernail? Saying that 'It's OK you're not bleeding' or 'You won't die from it' would not comfort anybody at all. I would venture to say that it is surely mistaken to compare the pain at present with a probable outcome yet to happen.When hospital visitors became MERS patients, a typical example of nosocomial infection was demonstrated. It was a surprise attack, and the whole country was shaken and panicked. The WHO experts reminded us that hospital shopping greatly contributed to the rapid spread of MERS in Korea. We have to understand why patients pursue hospital shopping. The death of professionalism may be an unexpected result of the fashionable social network services (SNS). Patients use SNSs to data-mine their own diagnosis and prescription and then seek medical advice to compare with their own ideas about their personal health. However, such patients suggesting their own diagnoses and treatments can be described as 'Jack of all trades, master of none'. Medical informatics leadership was nowhere to be found. When the MERS epidemic turned fatal, SNS was the only rescue. MERS was unknown to the general public, and the cure was uncertain, so chaos was bound to happen.In Korea medical informatics is on trial. We are standing in front of a river that runs medicine. IT has been trying to cross the river but has never been successful, especially in medical expert systems. The other side of the river is not the land of promise. Because the river of medicine eventu-ally runs into the ocean of the human race, why don't we go with the river instead? There is no doubt that doctors and nurses were the final frontiers in the MERS battle. Despite all the wonderful scientific accomplishments, the MERS crisis reminds us that clinical expertise is the most important value as clearly as ever. Technology can help medicine, not the other way around; that is the way medical informatics should go in between.Taoism states that dynamic balance can be obtained from two opposite powers competing with each other, unifying as a complete energy. Similarly, medical informatics should be able to balance between analog medicine and digital technology to create a new value. Medicine is composed of oldfashioned values, such as rapport, which is fading out slowly. Digital technology should help clinicians restore the humanistic flavor of medicine by eliminating managerial overload in healthcare settings. Technology can start from there. Neither Cyclops (the single-eyed monster in Homer's Odyssey) nor Argus (the 100-eyed giant in Greek mythology) is ideal to find the right path. Two-eyed medical informaticians must walk through the path on the mountain ridge, carefully looking at both sides of IT and medicine for balance.In 1347, the first biological warfare took place in the siege of Caffa (now Feodosia in Ukraine) on the Black Sea coast. The Mongol army with bubonic plague catapulted corpse of those who had died from the Black Death over the city walls. Fleeing from central trading ports along the coast, infected inhabitants and rats may have carried the disease throughout Europe [7] (The plague might have killed more than 25 million people). A few regions survived. They simply closed their ports of entry and isolated patients in remote places. The same principle still applies. When in doubt, isolate an infection until it's clear. Time goes by, technology advances, but the basic principle never changes. Medicine should stay analog with a little hint of digital. That's all it takes to fight against any epidemic or pandemic attack in the future."}, {"qas" : [{"question":"What is the structure of the virus?", "id": "0a0bc6bc993e37df9be46a2c80e969cbac5a89db", "is_impossible": false}], "context" : "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae and is a single stranded RNA virus with three major structural proteins, including a nucleocapsid protein (Lai, 1990) . Studies on the pathogenesis of FIPV in both domestic and exotic cats have demonstrated that an acute, fulminant disease (so-called 'wet' or 'effusive' FIP) can occur on challenge of seropositive cats as compared with a milder response (so-called 'dry' or 'non-effusive' FIP) in seronegative cats (for a review see Pedersen, 1983) . It is believed that the presence of pre-existing antibody leads to either immune complex deposition (Jacobese-Geels, Daha and Horzinek, 1982) or antibodydependent enhancement of macrophage infection upon challenge by FIPV (Olsen, Corapi, Ngichabe, Baines and Scott, 1992) . Therefore, naturally and experimentally ini~cted domestic cats develop lesions with a marked variation in intensity, depending on the cat's antibody status.The lesions in domestic cats infected with FIPV are of perivascular necrotizing pyogranulomatous inflammation and fibrinous serositis with FIPV particles present within macrophages in these lesions (Weiss and Scott, 1981 b). Similar lesions have been reported in a number of exotic cats kept in zoological gardens (Colly, 1973) ; however, they have not been previously reported in the European wildcat. A serological survey of freeliving European wildcats in Great Britain did not detect any animals seropositive for FIPV (McOrist, Bold, Jones, Easterbee, Hubbard and Jarrett, 1991) . This study provided an opportunity to examine the pathological and epidemiological features of naturally occurring infectious peritonitis in a closed colony of European wildcats.The European wildcat (Fells silvestris) colony was housed in a single enclosure exhibit 15 m × 8m × 3 m, at a Scottish Zoological Garden, from 1978 to 1992. The two founder wildcats were purchased from the same source in 1976, placed in this enclosure and had their first litter in 1978. There were no further introductions. Their diet was fresh horse or chicken meat. The details of the size and dates of litter births, and dates of deaths in the colony are given in Fig. 1 . Between 1982 and 1992 necropsies were performed on 17 animals. The major clinical signs (if any) reported in the five wildcats subsequently diagnosed as having infectious peritonitis included nervous signs (three of five) and weight loss (three of five), respiratory signs (two of five) and abdominal distension (two of five). No cats with clinical FIP survived the disease.Selected tissues were fixed in buffered neutral formalin and were routinely processed to paraffin wax for histopathological examination. Sections were routinely stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Immunocytochemical localization of FIPV antigen in paraffit>embedded tissues was demonstrated by an avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase method (Vectastain, Vector Lab, U.S.A.) alter pre-digestion of the de-waxed sections with 1 per cent trypsin solution ['or Anti-FIPV nucleocapsid goat serum was used as a primary antibody at a dilution of 1 in 50. In addition to this indirect antibody detection system, serum from a domestic cat, confirmed as suffering from infectious peritonitis at necropsy, was biotinylated and then used in a separate avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method.Tissues from three healthy cats and from cats suffering from parasitic pneumonia were used to provide sections containing uninfected macrophages. Normal goat serum was used as a serum control for the indirect staining techniques.Lesions were noted in the liver, kidneys, intestine, brain, lungs, heart and lymphoid tissues. Despite the numerous deaths in young kittens indicated in Fig. 1 , no conclusive evidence of any specific process was detected on examination and a presumptive diagnosis of 'fading kitten syndrome' was made.In cats dying of infectious peritonitis in 1982 or 1986 (see Fig. 1 ), there were rnacroscopical lesions in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, with ill-defined areas (up to 5 cm long) of thickening of the wall of the intestine, and of the surface of the liver and pleura, by soft, fawn-coloured tissue. These cavities contained variable amounts (5 to 50 ml) of thick, flocculated, red-brown fluid. There was also patchy lung consolidation.In cats dying of infectious peritonitis in 1991 or 1992, macroscopical lesions were noted in the liver and kidney. There was firm, diffuse, pale degenerative parenchyma with thickened, fibrous serosal surfaces. No gross brain lesions were detected.Histologically, there were lesions of the serosa and blood vessels in all cats. The serosal surfaces of the liver, spleen, intestine, heart and lungs were markedly thickened with fibrin deposition and a diffuse leucocytic infiltration consisting mostly of neutrophils, with some macrophages and lymphocytes. In cats dying in 1991 or 1992 the thickening consisted offibrovascular granulation tissue, with infiltration by macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Blood vessels, particularly medium sized arteries and veins, showed marked thickening &the tunica adventitia, with infiltration ofmacrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Other lesions were present in the parenchyma of the lung and liver. In the lung parenchyma of the cat dying in 1992 there was acute inflammation of alveoli with marked intra-alveolar haemorrhage. Numerous macrophages were present in alveolar and bronchiolar lumina and there were marginated mononuclear cells in the pulmonary veins and arterioles. In the hepatic parenchyma of this animal there were apparently sequential stages of hepatic necrosis which originated with loci ofhepatocyte syncytium formation (with no local inflammatory response) and progressed to loci of necrosis with neutrophil infiltration (Fig. 2) .Vascular lesions were marked in the liver and intestinal serosa &all cats, and the kidneys, lungs, meninges, heart muscle and pericardium of cats dying in 1991 or 1992. hnmunohislochemist~y FIPV antigen was observed in immunohistological preparations in macrophages in lesions from all cats. FIPV antigen-positive macrophages were particularly apparent in the pulmonary (alveolar macrophages), serosal and vascular lesions (see Fig. 3 ). In lung, antigen-positive macrophages were associated with areas of acute inflammation and haemorrhage and were present in both alveoli and bronchioles. The proportion of positive cells varied throughout the lesions, in some areas reaching over 90 per cent of potential target cells. Positive cells were present adherent to vascular endothelium in both arterioles and veins. Few positive cells were seen in the pulmonary interstitium or in peribronchial or peribronchiolar tissues, the majority of positive ceils being located in airway or alveolar lumina or adherent to vascular endothelium. In hepatic parenchyma occasional hepatocytes and hepatocyte syncytia stained positively, with no evidence of viral antigen in adjacent macrophages. As these lesions became necrotic the hepatocyte staining became less intense and antigen became localized in macrophages in the lesion.No FIPV antigen was detected in tissues from healthy cats or cats with parasitic pneumonia.This study indicated that an exotic cat, closely related to the domestic cat, was susceptible to FIP, and that the type of lesions seen in an extended outbreak in a closed colony varied with time, probably depending on the immune status of affected animals. Early in the outbreak, European wildcats developed an acute, effusive 'wet' form of infectious peritonitis, whereas in the later years of the outbreak, chronic 'dry' lesions of peritonitis produced a debilitating form of the disease with nervous signs present in some animals due to meningeal vasculitis. This study was the first to use immunohistochemistry to locate FIPV antigen in exotic cats and the distribution of antigen detected was similar to that recorded in FIPV infection of domestic cats (Weiss and Scott, 1981 a,b) . Therelbre the similarity of clinical and pathological features in these exotic cats affected with infectious peritonitis to those seen in domestic cats was probably due to the viral infection of macrophages and consequent development of lesions occurring in a similar manner. Also, the alteration in the type of lesion over the 10-year outbreak indicated that the immune status of the individuals varied with their age, as animals dying of the 'wet' form of FIP early in the outbreak were 3 and 7 years old and those dying later in the outbreak of'dry' FIP were 9 or l0 years old. This may also reflect a difference in the incubation times of the two forrns of the disease.The source of the virus could not be determined in this outbreak. The design of the enclosure made contact with domestic cats unlikely. It is possible that a virus-positive carrier may have introduced the virus and been the mechanism by which the virus persisted in the colony over a period of 10 years. Coronaviruses related to FIPV can be present in lkline faeces (Pedersen, Boyle, Floyd, Fudge and Baker, 1981) period of the 'dry' FIP may be several months, affected animals may harbour and shed virus for some time before developing clinical signs and dying. Interestingly, all the animals that died of confirmed FIP were male, despite approximately equal (10 vs 12) numbers of male and female offspring in the colony. Apparent increased susceptibility of males has also been noted in domestic cats (Potkay, Bacher and Pitts, 1974; Robinson, Holzworth and Gilmore, 1971) , although other studies have shown no particular sex predisposition (Pedersen, 1976) . In the outbreak in a domestic cat colony reported by Potkay and colleagues a seasonal incidence of deaths due to FIP was noticed, with most occurring during the winter months. Similarly, in this colony four of the five deaths occurred between October and March. The reason for this is unclear although 'stress' factors of temperature variation have been suggested. Poor neonatal survival of kittens was also a problem in this colony, seven of 22 kittens having died within one month of birth. Although none of these deaths were closely investigated this type of syndrome has been associated with FIPV infection (McKiernan, Evermann, Hargis, Miller and Ott, 1981) .The major target for FIP infection is the macrophage but we lbund that hcpatocytes may also be infected. In this study lesions due to hepatocyte infection were the earliest changes detectable in the liver, with syncytium formation and necrosis. These lesions were analogous to those caused by another coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (Blackmore, Guillon and Schwanzer, 1981) . Macrophages in the liver of the wildcats, including Kupffer cells, were also infected with the virus. As virus is rarely found free in the blood a cell-borne transmission to the hepatocyte is likely, probably via the Kupffer cells. The frequency of infection ofnon-macrophage cells in other organs is not known but was not common in this study."}, {"qas" : [{"question":"What is the structure of the virus?", "id": "00a0ab182dc01b6c2e737dfae585f050dcf9a7a5", "is_impossible": false}], "context" : "The world was made aware of a newly discovered coronavirus via an email from Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki, an Egyptian virologist working at the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah in The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The email was published on the website of the professional emerging diseases (ProMED) network on 20- September-2014 (ProMED, 2014 . That first case was a 60 year old man from Bisha in the KSA and, thanks to the email, the rapid discovery of a second case of the virus, this time in an ill patient from Qatar, was transferred to the United Kingdom for care ( Fig. 1) (Bermingham et al., 2012) . As of 20th January 2015, there have been 969 detections of viral RNA or virus-specific antibodies reported publicly, 955 confirmed by the World Health Organization (WHO), with over a third of the positive people dying (n = 351, 37%; data from public sources including the WHO and Ministries of Health). First known as novel coronavirus (nCoV), the following two to three years were a slow discovery process revealing a virus that appears well established among dromedary camels (DC; Camelus dromedarius) across the Arabian Peninsula and parts of Africa. From infected DCs, the virus is thought to infrequently infect exposed humans. Concern was raised early on that patenting of the first viral isolate would lead to restricted access to the virus and to viral diagnostics (Sciencemag, 2014) . However, sensitive, validated reverse transcriptase real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-rtPCR)-based diagnostics were available (Abdel-Moneim, 2014) almost immediately. Virus was also made freely available subject to routine biosafety considerations, supporting many of the research findings described herein. In search of an animal host, bats were implicated in August 2013 but in that same month a DC link was reported (Reusken et al., 2013c) and that link has matured into a verifiable association. In humans, overt disease was finally given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome and the acronym MERS. From these animal-to-human spillover events, the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV; see Section 3 for variation in naming) spread sporadically among people, causing more severe disease among older males with underlying diseases. The proportion of infected people who are confirmed to have died from MERS-CoV infection is much higher than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, influenza virus or many other pathogens. The spread of MERS-CoV among humans has often been associated with outbreaks in hospitals, which in 2012-2014 usually commenced in March (Mackay, 2014; Maltezou and Tsiodras, 2014) . This spread may be linked to some seasonal environmental changes, change in host animal behaviour, or perhaps simple coincidence between season and successive hospital outbreaks. Approximately a fifth of all cases to date have involved healthcare workers (HCWs), spiking alongside periods of increased total case numbers. Social media, blogs and the mainstream media have kept close tabs on the spread of MERS-CoV to 23 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States of America (USA; Fig. 2 ), mostly with an origin in the KSA from where 88% of viral detections have occurred. Twitter in particular has provided a global forum through specific hashtags like #MERS and the Arabic hashtag #AF4FD? or #Coruna. An engaged world has helped understand how the virus has affected the KSA and its neighbouring countries and allowed outsiders to view science musings take shape, collaborations form, local news and commentary trend and new results be discussed in real time. Social media provides new avenues for scientists to express experienced opinion, to more widely communicate their research and to engage with public health entities, the public themselves and the mainstream media. This degree of engagement was not possible in 2002/2003 when the SARS global outbreak began its rise to 8100 human cases including 770 deaths (proportion of fatal cases, or PFC, of 9.5%). The ubiquity of social media appears to have changed what the public expects from a State when it communicates about new or existing infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics, and how quickly they expect that to occur.Patients with MERS often present themselves to a hospital with systemic and lower respiratory tract (LRT) signs and symptoms of disease which usually include fever, chills or rigors, dry or productive cough, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and one or more comorbidities including diabetes (prevalent in the KSA), chronic kidney disease including renal failure, chronic heart disease and heart failure, recent surgery, hypertension, chronic lung disease, asthma, obesity, smoking, malignant disease or steroid use (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . MERS-CoV may be identified in patients with severe hypoxaemic respiratory failure and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction which can precede death in over a third of infections (Arabi et al., 2014; Assiri et al., 2013a; Hijawi et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . Extrapulmonary disease manifestations include circulatory, renal, hepatic and hematologic dysfunction. Gastrointestinal symptoms have been seen in 20-33% of cases (Assiri et al., 2013a; Mailles et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) , manifesting as diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Gastrointestinal symptoms were not seen at all in one family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) nor among symptomatic children in another . On occasion, fever and gastrointestinal upset may form a prodrome, after which symptoms decline to be are later followed by more severe systemic and respiratory signs and symptoms (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Mailles et al., 2013) . Rarely, MERS-CoV has been detected in a person with fever but no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms . The extent to which infection by other gastrointestinal pathogens affect this variability is unknown.Chest radiography of MERS patients, as distinct from MERS-CoV positive people with a subclinical infection, reveal infiltrates consistent with acute viral pneumonia (Assiri et al., 2013a; Devi et al., 2014; Tsiodras et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2012) . Only on rare occasions have studies described upper respiratory tract (URT) signs and symptoms. In one example, approximately 15-25% of cases presented with rhinorrhoea and/or sore throat Memish et al., 2013b; Payne et al., 2014; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . To date, MERS has been an opportunistic disease. Severe MERS has been defined by admission to an intensive care unit; use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), mechanical ventilation or vasopressors; cases being reported as critical or severe; a fatal outcome (Arabi et al., 2014) . The relative speed of disease progression may relate to MERS-CoV reaching earlier peak viral loads and infecting different cells than the SARS-CoV (Drosten, 2013) . Nonetheless, it is also apparent that MERS is not restricted to those with comorbidities. With increased laboratory testing, particularly of contacts of confirmed MERS cases, a number of MERS-CoV positive individuals without comorbidities have been detected who experience a mild illness or no symptoms at all (Al-Tawfiq and . This demonstrates that MERS, like most respiratory viruses, is associated with a wide spectrum of symptoms and degrees of severity.The mean incubation period in a study of 47 cases was 5.2 days, with 95% of cases having shown symptoms within 12.4 days (Assiri et al., 2013a) . In a smaller study the incubation period ranged between one and nine days, with 13-14 days between when illness began in one person and subsequently spread to another . The length and nature of the prodrome is undefined to date. The first WHO case definition (World Health Organization, 2014a) defined probable cases of MERS based on the presence of febrile illness, cough, requirement for hospitalization with suspicion of LRT involvement and included roles for contact with a probable or confirmed case or for travel or residence within the Arabian peninsula. If strictly adhered to, only the severe syndrome would meet the case definition and be subject to laboratory testing, which was the paradigm early on (Assiri et al., 2013a) . From July 2013, the revised WHO case definition included the importance of seeking out and understanding the role of asymptomatic cases (World Health Organization, 2014d) . Apart from reports from the WHO and KSA Ministry of Health, asymptomatic or subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection have also been documented in the scientific literature Memish et al., 2014b) . In one such case, a HCW shed virus for 42 days in the absence of disease (Al-Gethamy et al., 2014) .MERS can progress to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring external ventilation and then to multiorgan failure (Devi et al., 2014; Reuss et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2012) similar to severe influenza and SARS cases . Acute renal failure can occur in MERS patients, doing so sooner than it did among SARS patients (Eckerle et al., 2013) . Progressive impairment of renal function and acute kidney injury can start 9-12 days after symptom onset among MERS patients, compared to a median of 20 days for SARS patients (Chu et al., 2005; Eckerle et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . This may be due to direct infection of renal tissue by MERS-CoV (Arabi et al., 2014; Zaki et al., 2012) . Haematologic changes in MERS cases include thrombocytopenia (Assiri et al., 2013a; Drosten et al., 2013; Omrani et al., 2013) and lymphocytosis (Assiri et al., 2013a) or lymphopenia (Assiri et al., 2013a; Omrani et al., 2013) on admission (Assiri et al., 2013a) . Monocyte numbers are often normal (Assiri et al., 2013a) while neutrophils may be raised or normal (Assiri et al., 2013a) .As a group, children have rarely been reported to be positive for the virus. Between 1st September 2012 and 2nd December 2013, 11 paediatric cases (2-16 years of age; median 13-years) were identified in total; nine were asymptomatic (72%) and one died . In Amman, Jordan, 1005 samples from hospitalised children under the age of 2-years with fever and/or respiratory signs and symptoms were tested but none were positive for MERS-CoV RNA, despite being collected at a similar time to the first known outbreak of MERS-CoV in the neighbouring town of Al-Zarqa (Khuri-Bulos et al., 2013) . A second trimester stillbirth occurred in a pregnant woman during an acute respiratory illness and while not RT-rtPCR positive, the mother subsequently developed antibodies to MERS-CoV, suggestive of recent infection . Her exposure history to a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive relative and an antibody-reactive husband, her incubation period and her symptom history met the WHO criteria for being a probable MERS-CoV case .The virus associated with MERS was initially identified as the 'novel coronavirus' or nCOV; a problematic choice given that other novel coronaviruses could be discovered and were being discovered with regularity prior to and since the identification of MERS-CoV. When the first genome of a human variant was sequenced it was named human betacoronavirus 2c EMC (subsequently referred to here as EMC/2012), with the implication that it was a human not animal coronavirus. There were also variants named England-Qatar, Jordan-N3 and England 1. Ten months after its discovery, the coronavirus study group assembled an international consensus and the virus was renamed and given the acronym of MERS-CoV (de Groot et al., 2013) .MERS-CoV is a putative member of a new species (van Boheemen et al., 2012) within the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Coronavirinae, genus Betacoronavirus, subgroup 2c (Raj et al., 2014b) . The first full sequence defined a singlestranded, positive sense, 30,119 nucleotide (nt) long genome ( Fig. 3) (van Boheemen et al., 2012; Zaki et al., 2012) . Based on analysis of 42 complete sequences, the genome is predicted to be evolving at 1.12 × 10 −3 substitutions per site (Cotten et al., 2014) . This permitted a predictive calculation of the time to most recent viral ancestor (tMRCA) for most of the variants, which suggested MERS-CoV first appeared around March 2012 (ranging from December 2011 to July 2012) (Cotten et al., 2014) . Comparison of the first open reading frame's (ORF 1ab) amino acid sequence to that from its closest betacoronavirus relatives, Tylonycteris bat HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat HKU5, found there was less than 80% identity which supported the conclusion that MERS-CoV was a novel and distinct virus. This genomic region is a key taxonomic identifier of CoV species. MERS-CoV is predicted to encode at least ten open reading frames bracketed by /2012 variant isolated from sputum of a 60-year old man from Bisha, KSA) . Open reading frames are indicated as yellow rectangles bracketed by terminal untranslated regions (UTR; grey rectangles). The 5 UTR includes the predicted leader (L) transcription-regulatory sequence. FS-frame-shift. Predicted papain-like proteinase cleavage sites are indicated with orange arrows resulting in ∼16 cleavage non-structural protein products (based on (van Boheemen et al., 2012) ). The genome is drawn to scale using Geneious v6.1.6 and annotated using Adobe Illustrator. MERS-CoV EMC/2012 sequence GenBank accession number JX869059 5 and 3 untranslated regions (Raj et al., 2014b) . Structural proteins include the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (van Boheemen et al., 2012) . Nonstructural proteins (nsps) from the products of ORF1a and ORF1b have been predicted, following identification of conserved domains and after comparative analysis with other coronaviral proteins. The nsps include a papainlike protease (PLpro; nsp4 (Kilianski et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2014) transmembrane domains (nsp4, nsp6), a 3C-like protease (3CLpro; nsp5 (Kilianski et al., 2013) ), an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp; nsp12), a helicase (nsp13) and an exonuclease (nsp14) (van Boheemen et al., 2012) .Complete genome deduction using deep sequencing methods has been the predominant tool for genome analysis during the emergence of MERS-CoV (Cotten et al., 2013a (Cotten et al., ,b, 2014 the first time it's use has been so pervasive for the study of a viral outbreak with global reach. While the error rate can be higher than for traditional Sanger sequencing, the near-complete genomic length covered by just a single run (e.g. 90% of the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 genome) and the depth of coverage at each nucleotide is such that deep sequencing corrects for erroneous nucleotide van Boheemen et al., 2012) . Subgenomic sequencing, a mainstay of viral genotyping and molecular epidemiology to this point, has been used rarely for MERS-CoV identification or confirmation, despite assays having been suggested early on Corman et al. (2012b) . Such an approach is simpler, more accessible to a wider range of laboratories and faster. It's utility has since been demonstrated using molecular assays to amplify and sequence a 615 nucleotide long fragment of the spike S2 domain gene fragment (Smits et al., 2015) . This assay agreed with the results generated by the sequencing of full genomes and defined additional sequence groupings within an existing MERS-CoV clade. With the addition of more genomes over time from both humans and from DCs, two clades have become apparent; A and B. Clade A contains only human-derived MERS-CoV genomes ( Fig. 4) .To date, the MERS-CoV genomes collected from samples spanning just two years are genetically very similar to each other. An alignment of 56 complete or near-complete MERS-CoV genomes sampled from 2012 to 2014 differed by 0-0.38%. For comparison, an alignment of 31 complete HCoV-NL63 genomes from samples collected between 1983 and 2009 shows they diverge by 0.5% at the nucleotide level (data not shown; theoretically equates to 145nt for a 27,553nt genome). There is as yet no study which attaches clinical relevance to the clades or smaller groupings of MERS-CoV nor any of the genomic variation noted to date . It is interesting that Clade A contains only the African green monkey kidney (Vero; innate immune deficient cells) cell-culture passaged EMC/2012 variant and two variants of the Jordan-N3 variant from 2012, but no camel-derived MERS-CoV genomes . When the MERS-CoV genome of the variant from Bisha was re-sequenced directly from the original URT sample, the comparison of trimmed genomes (EMC/2012 vs. Bisha 1) revealed 115 nucleotide differences (0.38% difference) resolving Bisha 1 into Clade B . This is unusual because when a Jordan-N3 virus was intentionally serially passed through Vero or MRC5 cell culture (Jordan-N3/2012 MG167), only 2nt changes occurred within the entire coding region of the resultant sequence, despite eight passages (Frey et al., 2014) . For comparison, after three passages through Vero cell culture, no genetic changes were found in a DC MERS-CoV variant of Qatar 2 2014 .A very divergent MERS-CoV variant originated from an Egyptian DC likely imported from Sudan was identified as NRCE-HKU205|Nile|2013. It constructs a lineage outside the current clades, perhaps comprising the first occupant of Clade C Cotten et al., 2013b; Smits et al., 2015) . This lineage may represent additional diversity of MERS-CoV variants remaining to be discovered in DC from outside the Arabian peninsula. A virus sequenced from a Neoromicia capensis bat was more closely related to MERS-CoV than previous bat sequences had been, providing a link between human, camel and bat viruses as members of the same CoV species . Despite usually comprising ≤1% of the total genome, in silico comparison shows that viral genetic changes among variants permit geographic tracking of the spread of variants and identification that Riyadh, in particular, harbours a wide range of MERS-CoV variants ( Fig. 4) . This process of molecular epidemiology can also imply some physical direction to the movement of MERS-CoV around the region and over time (Cotten et al., 2014) .When compared to Bisha 1 2012, most single nucleotide differences among variants were located in the last third of the genome, encompassing the S protein (Fig. 5 ) and accessory proteins . At least nine MERS-CoV genomes harbour amino acid substitutions in the ribosome binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and codons 158 (N-terminal region), 460 (RBD), 1020 (in heptad repeat 1), 1202 and 1208 bear investigation as markers of adaptive change (Cotten et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014a) . Studies are needed to determine whether there any functional outcomes on virus replication and transmission due to these and future changes (Cotten et al., 2014 ). An early in vitro analysis did not find differences in shedding, replication or immune escape among viruses isolated up to May 2014 . The location and crystal structure of the RBD was described in several reports from mid-2013 Du et al., 2013b; Lu et al., 2013; Mou et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013) .Early diagnostic methods appeared within days of the ProMED email announcing the first MERS case. These included Vero and LLC-MK2 cell culture and several in-house RT-rtPCR assays (Fig. 6 ) (Corman et al., 2012a,b; Zaki et al., 2012) . Antibody testing of human sera remains rare.RT-rtPCR assays validated by Corman et al. were quickly recommended by the WHO having been shown to be sensitive The genetic relationship between all near-complete and complete MERS-CoV genome nucleotide sequences (downloaded from GenBank using the listed accession numbers; England2 was obtained from http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/MERSCoV/respPartialgeneticsequenceofnovelcoronavirus/%5D). This neighbour joining tree was created in MEGA v6 using an alignment of human and DC-derived MERS-CoV sequences (Geneious v6). The tree was rooted using NRCE-HKU205 CAMEL KJ477102. Clades are indicated next to dark (Clade A) or pale (Clade B) blue vertical bars. Camel icons denote genomes from DC. MERS-CoV sequences described as originating from the same patient either before (Bisha 1) or after (EMC/2012) passage in cell culture are starred (red). Identical genomes from a human and one of his ill camels from Jeddah (Azhar et al., 2014a) , the KSA are also starred (yellow). Healthcare or community outbreaks are boxed (blue, green, pink) and labelled. and specific (Corman et al., 2012a,b) . The target sequences of the recommended screening assays remained conserved among genomes until at least mid-2014 when last checked by IMM (Fig. 6) .RT-rtPCR on the upstream E region (upE; Fig. 6 6 . A schematic depicting the location of primers (blue arrows indicate direction) and oligoprobes (green rectangles) for the earliest RT-rtPCR screening assays and conventional, semi-nested (three primers) RT-PCR confirmatory sequencing assays (Corman et al., 2012a,b performed the Hajj in 2013, with no cases being identified (Memish et al., 2014d) . This may reflect the absence of MERS-CoV, no LRT testing (Memish et al., 2014d) or that 61% of pilgrims were arriving from countries without any known MERS-CoV circulation. Similarly, no MERS-CoV was identified during the 2012 in Hajj among the nasal swabs from 154 pilgrims tested by RT-rtPCR (Corman et al., 2012a) before leaving for and departing from, the KSA nor from 114 swabbed pilgrims with influenza-like illness in the KSA during the Hajj in 2013 (Barasheed et al., 2014; Gautret et al., 2013) . Across a period of rapid case accumulation and intense screening in Jeddah during March to July 2014 (called the Jeddah-2014 outbreak hereafter), ∼5000 samples were tested in a month yielding ∼140 MERS-CoV detections (∼3% prevalence) (MERS, 2014g). Among 5065 individuals sampled and tested across the KSA between 1st October 2012 and 30th September 2013, 108 (2.1%) detections were made using the upE and ORF 1a assays. This was a hospitalcentric population which included hospitalised cases (n = 2908), their families (n = 462) and associated HCWs (n = 1695) . Among the detections, 19 were HCWs and 10 were family contacts . During times of high MERS-CoV activity, its 2-3% prevalence is not very different from a more hospital-based prevalence for other HCoVs (Mackay et al., 2012) . Given the proportion of deaths among those infected with MERS-CoV, it is not a virus that should reasonably be described as a 'storm in a teacup', however to date it has been given many 'opportunities' for worldwide spread and it has not yet taken any of them.Data have shown one or more RT-rtPCR negative URT samples from clinically suspect MERS cases may be contradicted by further URT sampling or the preferred use of LRT samples (Bermingham et al., 2012; Omrani et al., 2013) . Higher viral loads occur in the LRT compared to the URT, especially with increasing time from onset of symptoms (CDC, 2014; Drosten et al., 2013; Memish et al., 2013b) . Since the majority of disease symptoms appear to have been manifesting as systemic and LRT disease, this may not be surprising (Assiri et al., 2013a) . However at writing, no human data exist to define whether the virus replicates solely in the LRT, the URT, has a preference for one over the other, or replicates in other human tissues in vivo. Sampling of the URT has been frequently noted from the largest human MERS-CoV investigative studies (Gautret et al., 2013 ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; Memish et al., 2014b,d) and, if noted, for other smaller investigative MERS-CoV testing (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013b) . In a macaque monkey model, MERS-CoV RNA was shed from both the URT and LRT (deWit et al., 2013) . In a human case, throat swabs were positive for six days, and again after a gap (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . In another case, a 40-year old female HCW shed MERS-CoV RNA from the URT (Ziad A. Memish, personal communication) for at least 42-days between April and June 2014 (Al-Gethamy et al., 2014) . She did not show signs of disease during her time shedding virus. In a study of MERS cases in an intensive care setting, three of 12 patients shed virus for 12-22 days (Arabi et al., 2014) . Elsewhere, viral RNA was detected in human oronasal swabs for 16 days and in pharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates for 24 days . Over three quarters of MERS cases shed viral RNA in their lower respiratory tract specimens (tracheal aspirates and sputum) for at least 30 days while only 30% of contacts were still shedding RNA in their upper respiratory specimens (Memish et al., 2014e) .The LRT is a WHO-recommended sampling site for MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR testing, especially when collection of samples will be delayed by a week or more after symptom onset (World Health Organization, 2013b) . Samples to test include bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), tracheal/tracheobronchial aspirate, pleural fluid and sputum (CDC, 2014; World Health Organization, 2013b) . Fresh samples yield better diagnostic results than refrigerated material and if delays of ≥72 h are likely, samples (except for blood) should be frozen at −70 • C (CDC, 2014). Lung biopsy or autopsy tissues can also be tested if available (World Health Organization, 2013b) . From the URT, which is a less invasive and convenient sampling site, a combined nose and throat swab or a nasopharyngeal aspirate is recommended (CDC, 2014) . Paired sera, collected two to three weeks apart are preferable for serological testing while a single sample is preferred if collected two weeks after onset of disease (World Health Organization, 2013b).Urine has been found to contain MERS-CoV RNA 12 and 13 days after symptom onset and stool samples were RT-rtPCR positive up to 16 days after onset Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) ; both sample types should be considered (CDC, 2014; World Health Organization, 2013b) . In two cases that arrived in the Netherlands, urine was RT-rtPCR negative but faeces was weakly positive while sera were RT-rtPCR positive for five days or more (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . MERS-CoV viral RNA detection in serum has proven a useful retrospective source of PCR template when respiratory samples were not available (Hijawi et al., 2013) . RNAaemia may also correlate with disease severity; signs of virus cleared from serum in one recovered human case while lingering until the death of another (Faure et al., 2014) .In a study of different sample types (64 nasopharyngeal [NPA], 30 tracheal aspirates, 13 sputa and 3 BAL), tracheal aspirates and BAL returned the best viral load values followed by NPA and sputum, which generally equated with whole genome sequencing success (Memish et al., 2014c) . This represents the only study of the effect of sample type on molecular analysis and it confirmed both the importance of LRT sampling for whole genome sequencing, while noting that 57% of samples from 112 distinct patients in the KSA in fact originated from the URT (Memish et al., 2014c) .Many studies make no mention of additional testing for endemic human respiratory viruses or bacteria (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Devi et al., 2014) . When viruses are sought, they include some of the following: human herpesvirus (HHV), rhinovirus (HRV), enterovirus (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenzavirus types 1, 2 and 3 (PIVs), influenzaviruses (IFVs), endemic HCoVs, adenoviruses (AdVs) and metapneumovirus (MPV) and co-detections with MERS-CoV do occur (Bermingham et al., 2012; Drosten et al., 2013 ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; Memish et al., 2013b) . When included, other viruses are often absent in the samples positive for MERS-CoV Bermingham et al., 2012; Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014; Omrani et al., 2013) but have been found in samples negative for MERS-CoV during such rare MERS investigations (Reuss et al., 2014) . Tests on the first human case in the KSA used a LRT sample to isolate MERS-CoV in culture, conduct immunofluorescence for some viruses (negative for IFV, PIVs, RSV and AdVs) and RT-PCR for other viruses (negative for AdV, EVs, MPV and HHVs) . RT-PCR also detected MERS-CoV. A case exported to Greece in April-2014 was tested (and found negative) for IFVs, Legionella and Pneumococcus . Other bacterial testing has been conducted but the impact of bacterial copresence is also unclear Devi et al., 2014; Memish et al., 2013b; Tsiodras et al., 2014) . Two MERS cases that travelled from the KSA to the Netherlands were negative for RSV, AdV, bocavirus (BoV), PIVs, HCoVs, HRV, IFVs, RSV and MPV (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Testing for other respiratory pathogens is strongly recommended (World Health Organization, 2013b) but limited data address the occurrence of co-infections or alternative viral diagnoses among both cases and contacts suspected of MERS-CoV infection. Little is known of other causes of MERS-like pneumonia in the KSA or of the general burden of disease due to the known classical respiratory viruses including endemic other human coronaviruses.Despite widespread use in elucidating the role of DCs as a source for MERS-CoV, no strategic and widespread sero-surveys have been conducted in humans using samples collected post-2012. The development of robust serological assays hinges on the accessibility of a reliable panel of well-characterised animal or human sera including those positive for antibodies specific to MERS-CoV and to likely agents of cross-reaction . Obtaining these control materials has been problematic and has slowed the development and commercialization of assays for human testing . One company has produced an ELISA kit to detect IgG in camels using a recombinant S1 receptor-binding subunit of MERS-CoV S protein as the antigen and produces a diagnostic reagent for immunofluorescence EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AGf, 2014) . Serosurveys are essential to determine a baseline of animal and community exposures to MERS-CoV among countries in the Arabian Peninsula. Early sero-surveys of humans used conventional immunofluorescent assays (IFA) in which antibodies, if present in patient sera, attach to MERS-CoV infected cell cultures to identify the presence of IgG, IgM or neutralising antibodies (Corman et al., 2012b; Drosten et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012) . No sign of MERS-CoV antibody was found among 2400 sera from patients visiting the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah, KSA from 2010 through 2012 , and no sign of prior MERS-CoV infection was found among 130 healthy blood donors screened at King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Jeddah (collected between January and December 2012). Eight of 226 slaughterhouse workers were positive by IFA, but those results could not be confirmed by neutralization (NT) test. The study indicated that HCoV-HKU1 was a likely source of cross-reactive antigen by IFA (Aburizaiza et al., 2014 ). An absence of MERS-CoV antibodies among slaughterhouse workers may reflect the killing of older DCs which are less often MERS-CoV positive (see Table 1 ), the rarity of infected animals, a limited transmission risk associated with slaughtering DCs (Aburizaiza et al., 2014) , a weak immune response by humans who do not get severe MERS, or an overall low risk of MERS-CoV transmission by contact. IFA also suffered from some cross-reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera which could not be resolved by an NT test (Chan et al., 2013b) . The need for well-validated assays was further emphasised when publicly released MERS-CoV antibody test results indicated that a handshake and two face-to-face meetings were sufficient for MERS-CoV transmission between two people in the USA (CDC Newsroom, 2014; Sampathkumar, 2014) . These results were subsequently retracted because they did not withstand further confirmatory analysis with the less rapid, but highly specific, NT assay (CDC Newsroom, 2014) .A more biologically safe IFA was developed that did not require infectious virus but was instead based on transfected cells expressing recombinant portions of the MERS-CoV N and S genes (Corman et al., 2012b; Reuss et al., 2014) . Recombinant lentiviruses expressing MERS-CoV S protein and luciferase are also safer and simpler diagnostic alternatives to working with infectious MERS-CoV Zhao et al., 2013) . A pseudo particle neutralization (ppNT) assay has seen widespread use in animal studies and is at least as sensitive as the microneutralization (MNT) test (Hemida et al., 2013 (Hemida et al., , 2014a (Hemida et al., , 2015 Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013b) . In a study of sera collected at the King Fahd Hospital, Eastern region of the KSA (158 from children with LRT infections between May 2010 and May 2011 and 110 from 19 to 52 year old male blood donors) no evidence of MERS-CoV neutralising antibody could be found using the ppNT assay (Gierer et al., 2013) . Similarly, in a study of four herdsmen in contact with an infected DC herd in Al-Ahsa, eight people who had intermittent contact with the herd, 30 veterinary surgeons and support staff who were not exposed to the herd, three unprotected abattoir workers in Al-Ahsa and 146 controls who were not exposed to camels in any professional role, none had serological evidence of past MERS-CoV infection using the ppNT assay (Hemida et al., 2015) .MERS-CoV does not appear to be easily transmitted from DCs to humans, or perhaps it does not trigger a detectable immune response if only mild disease or asymptomatic infection results.A study of such cases is an important missing link for interpretation of these negative human serology data. A Jordanian outbreak of acute LRT disease in a hospital in Al-Zarqa in 2012, which predated the first KSA case of MERS, was retrospectively found to have been associated with MERS-CoV infection, initially via RT-rtPCR, but subsequently, and on a larger scale, using positivity by ELISA and IFA or MNT test Hijawi et al., 2013; Payne et al., 2014) . The ELISA used a recombinant N protein from the group 2 betacoronavirus (Pipistrellus) bat-CoV HKU5 to identify antibodies against the equivalent cross-reactive MERS-CoV protein and was validated using 545 sera including some from people known to have had previous HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, HRV, HMPV or influenza A(H1N1) infections . A protein microarray expressing the S1 protein subunit has also been validated and widely used for DC testing (see Table 1 ) (Reusken et al., 2013a) but not for human screening to date. Using the most immunogenic portion or subunit of a specific viral antigen is considered the best approach for producing reliable serological assays . Detection of MERS-CoV infection using ELISA or S1 subunit protein microarray (Reusken et al., 2013a) has usually been followed by confirmatory IFA and/or a plaque-reduction neutralization (PRNT) test (Aburizaiza et al., 2014; Drosten et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013c) or MNT test Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013c) . The confirmatory methods ensure the antibodies detected using more subjective screening methods that may also employ a spectrum of potentially cross-reactive antigens, are able to specifically neutralise the intended virus and are not more broadly reactive to other coronaviruses found in DCs (bovine CoV, BCoV) or humans (HC0V-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV).Early work identified that a range of cells underwent cytopathic changes when infected with MERS-CoV in culture. These included cells from (Eckerle et al., 2013; Zaki et al., 2012; Zielecki et al., 2013) :• human tracheobronchial epithelium, • human primary renal epithelium, • African green monkey kidney (Vero and Vero E6; IFN-deficient),• rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2),• human bronchial epithelium (Calu-3).MERS-CoV grows more efficiently than SARS-CoV in primary bronchial cells and in primary kidney cells (Eckerle et al., 2013) .Other cells or cell lines that support MERS-CoV transcription include Muller et al., 2012) :• porcine kidney cancer (PS), • human kidney cancer (769-P), • human alveolar adenocarcinoma (A549), • bat kidney (Rousettus aegyptiacus, RoNi/7; Pipistrellus pipistrellus, PipNi/1 and PipNi/3; Carollia perspicillata, CarNi/1), • bat lung (Rhinolophus landeri, RhiLu; Myotis daubentonii,DC umbilical cord (TT-R.B) and bat kidney (PipNi) hosted MERS-CoV replication detected by RT-PCR and those from goat also produced the greatest amount of viable virus, followed by monkey, human, alpaca and bat cells . MERS-CoV N protein was produced by a range of infected mammalian cells including (Chan et al., 2013a,c) :• human ex vivo bronchial and lung tissue, • Calu-3, • embryonic foetal lung fibroblasts (HFL), • gastrointestinal (Caco-2), • liver (Huh-7), • kidney (HEK), • histiocytoma (His-1), • porcine kidney (PK-15),• civet lung (CL-1), • monkey kidney (LLC-MK2, Vero, Vero E6).Some cell lines did not support MERS-CoV growth, including (Chan et al., 2013a; Muller et al., 2012) :• baby hamster kidney (BHK), • African green monkey kidney (MA104),Kidney cells are a common source of passaged cell lines used in virology and they feature prominently in the list of MERS-CoVpermissive cell lines. It is noteworthy that diabetes is also one of the underlying diseases among two thirds of MERS-CoV positive people and that renal damage features among patients with severe disease (Assiri et al., 2013a) . When a pseudovirus expressing the MERS-CoV S protein was used to examine the binding of S to the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACE2), MHV (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule; CEACAM1) or HCoV-229E (CD13) which were expressed in nonpermissive 293T cells, it did not enter those cells, indicating these were not the receptor molecules for MERS-CoV . When ACE2 was expressed in otherwise non-permissive BHK cells, only SARS-CoV could infect them (Muller et al., 2012) . Additionally, blockade of ACE2 by antibodies only prevented SARS-CoV infection of cells otherwise permissive to that virus while MERS-CoV could still infect them (Muller et al., 2012 ).An extract from cells permissive for MERS-CoV infection (Huh-7 and Vero) yielded a ∼110 kDa protein bound by a recombinant MERS-CoV S protein domain S1. It was identified by mass spectrometry as the exopeptidase dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26), a type-II transmembrane glycoprotein . The receptor's identity was confirmed by the use of soluble DPP4 to competitively inhibit MERS-CoV infection of Vero cells as well as by transient expression of DPP4 in COS-7 cells which rendered them permissive to MERS-CoV (Memish et al., 2014f; Raj et al., 2013) . Anti-DPP4 antibodies also blocked human and DC MERS-CoV variants from infecting otherwise permissive human bronchial epithelial cells or Huh-7 cells respectively while inhibitors of the DPP4 function did not, indicating that structure, rather than function, was important for MERS-CoV attachment .DPP4 RNA-positive cells were detected by RT-PCR derived from goat lung, alpaca kidney, camel umbilical cord, bat kidney, human lung and monkey kidney . DPP4 protein was also found on epithelial cells of different species from organs including the kidney and renal ducts, small intestine, lung, umbilical cord, liver, prostate, activated leukocytes and in elevated levels in a soluble form in the blood of those with allergic asthma (Lun et al., 2007; Raj et al., 2013) . Limited DPP4 expression was found in the lung of MERS-CoV non-permissive animals including mice and Syrian hamsters, but it was present. DPP4 expression was also seen in ferret, DC, sheep, goat and cow bronchial/bronchiolar tissues and renal tubular tissues (Coleman et al., 2014b; van Doremalen et al., 2014) . When the structure of DPP4 from animals was modelled, a host-barrier restriction was predicted to exist among different mammals; DPP4 was present but some animals do not support MERS-CoV infection (van Doremalen et al., 2014) . When a human DPP4 was 'hamsterized' by exchanging five key MERS-CoV Sprotein-interacting residues and introduced into non-permissive BHK cells, they were not rendered permissive, whereas introduction of the human DPP4 into BHK cells successfully permitted their infection (van Doremalen et al., 2014) . Because of the high affinity of MERS-CoV for human DPP4, similar to that for animal DPP4 molecules, it is possible that the MERS-CoV which was detected in humans in 2012 was already modestly adapted to humans and that both DCs and horses, and to a lesser extent goats, should all be considered as sources for intrusion of the virus into human populations because of their degree of binding affinity (Barlan et al., 2014; Raj et al., 2014a) . To date, no sign of natural MERS-CoV infection has been found in goat, sheep, cow or alpaca, despite small seroprevalence studies. However, the DPP4 data suggest the possibility and these animals should be further examined as potential animal hosts (see Table 1 for detail on DCs).Asthmatics have been identified among MERS patients. DPP4 secretion may decrease in proportion to the level of cellular inflammation and the molecule has a role in T-cell activation and hence immune regulation (Boonacker and Van Noorden, 2003) , which may be important for asthmatic airway and MERS-CoV infection. While few studies have looked at DPP4 in the URT and none did so in relation to MERS-CoV, relevant enzymatic activity has been identified there and shown to decrease in the nasal mucosa of patients with rhinitis (inflammation), returning to normal after treatment and/or improvement (Grouzmann et al., 2002) .To date, the RBD of MERS-CoV have not undergone noteworthy genetic change, which could indicate that the RBD is not a crucial factor for species adaptation (Barlan et al., 2014) , or that time spent in humans has been too short to see such change develop. There is wide genetic diversity among the DPP4 sequences from different animal species, but those with the strongest affinity for MERS-CoV recombinant S protein are more closely related and have the most conservation among 14 amino acids within the human DPP4 sequence predicted to come into contact with the S protein (Barlan et al., 2014) .Autopsy material is not available from fatal MERS cases however such material reflects mostly late stage disease in patients who received numerous therapies and have spent time under mechanical ventilation (Chan et al., 2013c) . Therefore a disease model system is essential to study pathogenesis without the confounding influence of a raft of supportive medical procedures and of pre-existing chronic disease.Neither mice nor Syrian hamsters have supported natural MERS-CoV replication (Coleman et al., 2014b; Drosten, 2013) . To get around the divergence between murine and human DPP4, a mouse model was constructed by introducing a human DPP4 gene ). An adenoviral vector carrying the gene transduced cells in the mouse airway resulting in animals that were receptive to MERS-CoV infection for 17-22 days. Infection induced pneumonia in the animals and viral clearance followed 6-8 days after infection . The model found limited cross-protection afforded by prior exposure to SARS-CoV. Using this model, a Venezuelan equine encephalitis-based replicon expressing MERS-CoV spike protein was shown to be an efficacious vaccine candidate, producing a protective immune response . Subsequently a transgenic mouse model was created in which the human DPP4 was globally expressed resulting in a fully permissive model of severe MERS (Agrawal et al., 2015) . A report of a mouse model for infection by a MERS-CoV close relative, batCoV HKU5, noted that vaccine designs for any emerging CoV should include elements from that particular virus since different members of the same genus are insufficiently similar to elicit immunological crossprotection . Use of transduced knockout mice revealed that TLR-dependent and IFN-signalling pathways were important for control of MERS-CoV replication . Pre-infection delivery of poly I:C, IFN␤ or IFN␥ speeded the clearance of MERS-CoV from infected mice and did so more effectively than if poly I:C was given post-infection . IFN␣2b given with ribavirin improved clinical status and virological control in macaques, in association with reduced systemic and local levels of proinflammatory markers and viral load . T-cells were shown to be necessary for virus clearance in mice and immunodominant epitopes attracting CD8 T-cell responses are present in the MERS-CoV S protein ). The mouse model has shown that immune-deficient mice succumbed to more severe disease, as do humans with comorbidities that may affect their immune function.To date the only non-transduced animal model for MERS-CoV infection is the rhesus macaque monkey; an expensive animal to house and work with. A multi-site infection protocol delivered 7 × 10 6 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) of MERS-CoV to 6-12 year old macaques via a combination of intranasal, oral, ocular and intratracheal routes attempting to recreate the disease seen in humans (Yao et al., 2014) . This resulted in a transient mild-to-moderate clinical disease, including a leucocytosis, with acute localised-to-widespread radiographic changes consistent with pneumonia . Three days after infection, viral RNA was detected in the conjunctiva, nasal mucosa and also at day six in the tonsils, trachea, bronchus, mediastinal lymph nodes and lung, but mostly at reduced levels to those from day three (deWit et al., 2013) . By day six, virus was mostly undetectable in the URT, generally decreasing in quantity by day three and at its highest load one day after inoculation (deWit et al., 2013) . This is much shorter than has been found when serial samples from a human case were analysed (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Shedding from the respiratory tract continued until day six in two of three macaques (deWit et al., 2013) . Levels of viral RNA remained high in BAL samples on day one and three (deWit et al., 2013) . Virus or viral RNA was not found in the kidney, nor were pathological kidney changes or kidney failure noted among macaques (deWit et al., 2013; Yao et al., 2014) . Microarray analysis of MERS-CoV infected macaque samples identified a rapid innate immune activation with increased expression of genes involved in proinflammatory processes and cell recruitment including interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemokine C-X-C ligand 1 (CXCL1) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) (deWit et al., 2013) . By day six post inoculation, gene expression in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung had returned to baseline (deWit et al., 2013) . While the viral dosage and spread of delivery may be unrealistic, we have since learned that much milder disease is not uncommon among MERS-CoV-positive humans, especially those who are younger and do not have underlying comorbidities. The macaque model fulfilled the need to see a purified viral preparation produce disease akin to that seen among some human cases . The direct LRT component of virus delivery in this model likely reflects some proportion of the human route of virus acquisition and some of the notable human disease involving the LRT. However, it may also bias against study of any potential URT response to first contact between virus and host and therefore overlook routes of ingress and the length and nature of the prodrome. While MERS-CoV is believed to the cause of MERS in humans, such causality can only be extrapolated from these studies in the macaque model .MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were compared using human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures. These comprised bronchial epithelial cells that had been differentiated at the air liquid interface to contain basal, secretory, columnar and ciliated cells that generated mucous (Kindler et al., 2013) . This system aimed to recreate the main epithelial lining which is possibly the site of first contact between host and MERS-CoV (Kindler et al., 2013) . Pre-treatment of cultures with interferon ␣ (IFN␣) and IFN␥3 proved effective at reducing the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E (Kindler et al., 2013) . When IFN␣ or IFN␤ was added to ex vivo bronchial or lung tissues one hour after MERS-CoV infection, virus titre and RNA levels decreased more noticeably for MERS-CoV than for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also elicited a comparatively poor proinflammatory and cytokine response, but to the same extent as when pre-treated (Chan et al., 2013c) . MERS-CoV failed to induce IFN␤ or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF␣) or to upregulate IL-1␤, MCP-1 or regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) mRNA (Chan et al., 2013c) . However, MERS-CoV was perhaps a better replicator in these tissues than SARS-CoV and it's targeting of Type I and Type II alveolar cells within the lungs indicated its potential to hinder lung regeneration after infection, since Type II cells are important for repair (Chan et al., 2013c) . By comparison, HCoV-229E, a generally more mild pathogen, did not replicate in lung tissue while influenza A(H5N1) virus, known to be associated with viral pneumonia, did (Chan et al., 2013c) .Further immunobiological analysis using cell lines supported that MERS-CoV grows better, but is more sensitive to IFN␤, than SARS-CoV. MERS-CoV is also a very weak inducer of IFN, most likely through an immune dampening effect that both it and SARS-CoV mediate via retention of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Zielecki et al., 2013) . MERS-CoV was again shown to be more sensitive to IFN␤, although this was based on pre-treatment of cells, a situation that does not mimic clinical reality for human cases of MERS (Zielecki et al., 2013) . Kindler et al. noted that the comparatively limited transcriptional response after infection of HAE cultures by any CoV, with no induction of IFN␤ and only mild induction of proinflammatory cytokines, may mean that MERS-CoV is already adapted to growing in these cells (Kindler et al., 2013) . Professional cytokine-producing cells such as plasmacytoid and conventional dendritic cells and macrophages were lacking in the HAE system but were present in the ex vivo tissues above. These cells are needed to see the full extent of the immune response to CoVs (Kindler et al., 2013) . Use of an embryonal lung fibroblast cell line (HFL), to allow growth of HCoV-229E, identified more IFN␤ and IP-10 induction than that by MERS-CoV. In polarised Calu-3 cells, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV differed in their elicitation of cytokine gene transcription (Lau et al., 2013) . In a three-way virus comparison of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E, 15 cellular mRNAs were analysed in response to type I IFN and type III IFN and CoV infection (Kindler et al., 2013) . Proinflammatory gene (IL-1␤, IL-6 and IL-8) mRNA (and IL-8 protein) levels were increased in MERS-CoV infections compared to SARS-CoV, while innate antiviral genes (TNF␣, IFN␤ [and protein] and IP-10) were comparatively decreased from 30 h post-infection (Lau et al., 2013) . Apart from a reduced innate antiviral response, timing of the response also differed, with MERS-CoV appearing to delay cytokine induction. MERS-CoV produced less IL-8 or IFN␤ at 48 h compared to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV also grew less efficiently and destructively than MERS-CoV in Calu-3 cells, as it did in primary bronchial and primary kidney cells and it took longer to reach peak viral production (Eckerle et al., 2013; Kindler et al., 2013) .The growth of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV was also compared in cell cultures including primary undifferentiated human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (HTBE), Calu-3, Vero, human embryonic kidney (293) and in A549 cells. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV grew with similar kinetics in Calu-3 cells (Zielecki et al., 2013) , but Josset et al. noted MERS-CoV induced more significant cytopathic changes accompanying earlier and distinctive changes to the global transcriptome (Josset et al., 2013) . Fourteen-fold more differentially expressed genes were noted from MERS-CoV; uniquely down-regulated genes related to antigen presentation and lymphocyte signalling and up-regulated related to cAMPmediated signalling and ubiquitination (Josset et al., 2013) . The increased relative growth of SARS-CoV in Calu-3 cells compared to using HAE cultures above might reflect the latter's variable expression of the SARS-CoV receptor (Josset et al., 2013 (Josset et al., 2013; Kindler et al., 2013) . Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV upregulated viral recognition and innate immune pathway activation genes (IL17-related and interferon regulatory factor [IRF]) and down-regulated metabolic genes (Josset et al., 2013) . Because of the rapidity of MERS-CoV host cell expression changes, post-infection treatment with a kinase inhibitor was not as effective as pre-treatment (Josset et al., 2013) , reinforcing the challenges faced in treatment of MERS cases who present once disease processes are well engaged.MERS-CoV has been shown to infect and replicate within primary human monocyte-derived macrophages and produce considerable virus, in contrast to SARS-CoV which could enter, but not propagate within dendritic cells (Zhou et al., 2014) . Interestingly, MERS-CoV antigens were not found to co-localise with macrophages in infected ex vivo lung tissue (Chan et al., 2013c) . In contrast to the work in the HAE system, dendritic cell infection resulted in up-regulation of IFN␣ (though not IFN␤) and of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF␣ and IL-6 (Zhou et al., 2014) . Also, infection triggered significantly higher levels of IP-1o and RANTES than the equivalent dose of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2014) . In clinical practice, two MERS patients in France were found to differ in their IFN␣ responses (Faure et al., 2014) . Patient 1, who died, did not mount a robust type I IFN response while Patient 2, who survived, did mount a response; particularly notable in Patient 1 was the absence of IFN␣ and comparatively little RIG-I, MDA5, IRF3, IRF7, IL-12 and IFN␥ (Faure et al., 2014) . IFN␣ promotes the antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response to clear virus. Patient 1 also had a comparatively increased level of IL-1o (with its immunosuppressive role (Sabat, 2010) ), a spike in CXCL10 (a proinflammatory role) late in the course of disease and both patients had raised IL-17A (also proinflammatory).These immune studies raise questions about whether age and immune status or genetic disorders which affect IFN signalling and production could be a risk factor for severe MERS or whether the actions of MERS-CoV itself are sufficient to interfere with signalling.An animal as source and intermediate host(s) were considered very early on in the MERS outbreak with three of the first five cases having contact with DCs (Albarrak et al., 2012; ProMED, 2012; Reuss et al., 2014) . While unclear at that time, approximately 12 MERS-CoV detections from a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin between June and August 2013 were possibly triggered by the index case having had DC contact (Memish et al., 2014g) . Today, animal MERS-CoV infections must be reported to the world organization for animal health (OIE) as an emerging disease (2014f) . Animal contact with humans was defined in a summary of the first MERS cases as being direct and within 10 days prior to symptom onset (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . This definition made no specific allowance for acquisition through a droplet-based route, which is still assumed to be the most common route for acquisition of a virus that predominantly causes respiratory disease (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . Providing some support for a droplet transmission route, one report identified viral RNA in an air sample collected in a barn housing an infected DC (Azhar et al., 2014b ). The precise route by which humans acquire MERS-CoV remains unproven. From early on and continuing throughout the MERS epidemic in the KSA, older human males have featured prominently, especially among index cases, implying behavioural factors may play a role (Penttinen et al., 2013) , and these factors may provide important clues as to why so few human cases report DC contact and are reported to have had contact with an infected human, leaving this group without any obvious route of acquisition (Fig. 7) . Whether the above definition of animal contact is sufficient to capture exposure to this respiratory virus remains unclear. Cases are sometimes listed in WHO disease notices as being in proximity to camels or farms, but individuals may have denied coming into contact with the animals. No alternative path for acquiring infection is reported in many of these instances. Fewer than half of human cases have reported camel contact (Gossner et al., 2014) but what constitutes a definition of 'contact' during these interviews is unclear. In a May 2014 WHO update and risk assessment, specific wording focused on consumption of camel products while equivalent wording was not used to ascribe risk to a potential droplet route for acquisition of MERS-CoV from DC. For example:'Until more is understood about MERS, people at high risk of severe disease (those with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons), should take precautions when visiting farms and markets where camels are present. These precautions include: avoiding contact with camels; not drinking raw camel milk or camel urine; and not eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked' (World Health Organization, 2014c).Despite the early evidence of DC contact, the diversity of coronaviruses known to exist among bats made them a more widely discussed initial focus (Fig. 7) (Shi, 2013; Smith and Wang, 2013; Woo et al., 2009) . Nonetheless, to date the only MERS-CoV-specific data pointing to bats originate with a 190nt amplified fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of the MERS-CoV genome identified in the fecal pellet from an insectivorous Emballonuridae bat, Taphozous perforatus, commonly called the Egyptian tomb bat, from Bisha, KSA . While very short, the sequence of the fragment defined it as a diagnostic discovery and at writing no better sequence match exists on the GenBank sequence database. Unfortunately further sequence from this sample could not be obtained because the cold chain was broken when samples shipped to the USA for study thawed and decayed. The role of bats as the natural host of MERS-CoV or the host of a MERS-CoVlike virus remains to be proven.Dromedary camels, which make up 95% of all camels, have a central presence in the Arabian Peninsula and human-DC contact ranges from little to close (Gossner et al., 2014; MERS, 2014d) . Camel densities are greatest in and around the horn of Africa, specifically Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, Sudan and South Sudan (Gossner et al., 2014) . Near the KSA, Yemen has the highest density of camels, and within the country the Ha'il region is most densely populated with DCs (Gossner et al., 2014) despite there being no human MERS cases from this region. Contact may be commonplace and could occur in variety of ways (Fig. 8) . There are several large wellattended festivals, races, sales and parades which feature DCs and DCs are also kept and bred close to populated areas in the KSA (2014d). DC milk and meat are widely collected and consumed and the DC is an animal of ritual significance after the Hajj pilgrimage. However, MERS-CoV infection frequency appears much lower than does the more widespread and frequent habit of eating, drinking and preparing camel products. Daily ingestion of fresh unpasteurised DC milk is common among the desert Bedouin and many others in the KSA. Apart from its nutritional value, other perceived health benefits and availability, camel milk has been reported as an adjunct to standard type 1 diabetes management (Agrawal et al., 2009; Mohamad et al., 2009) . DC urine is also consumed or used for supposed health benefits including a belief that it will keep hair parasite-free and has reported application as an aspirin-like anti-platelet-aggregation substance (Alhaidar et al., 2011) and as a specific anti-cancer and immune modulation substance (Al-Yousef et al., 2012) .In August 2013, Reusken et al. reported the first sero-survey of livestock living in the region during 2012-2013 (Table 1) (Reusken et al., 2013c) . DCs were sampled from a mostly Canary Island-born (originally imported from the Horn of Africa in the 15th century) herd and from Omani DCs (mostly imported in high numbers and with high turnover, from Africa) retired from racing and tested using a protein microarray that expressed a portion of the receptorbinding S1 subunit of the S proteins from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 (Reusken et al., 2013a,c) . A range of other animals was also tested. All non-DC sera tested negative for MERS-CoV antibodies. A neutralising antibody assay found that 10% of strongly seropositive Canary Island DC sera could neutralise the virus while all of the Omani DC sera had high levels of specific MERS-CoV neutralising antibody (Reusken et al., 2013c) . This indicated that DCs had in the past been infected by MERS-CoV, or a very similar virus, but its spread to camels beyond these borders remained unclear.Since this study, a host of peer-reviewed reports have looked at DCs, and other animals, and the possibility that they may play host to MERS-CoV infection (Table 1 ). Seropositive DCs have been found throughout the Arabian Peninsula and in Africa Reusken et al., 2013c Reusken et al., , 2014b . Other animals tested include sheep, cows, pigs, horses, birds, water buffalo, goats, Bactrian camels, llamas and guanaco (south American camelids). Many of these animals have only been tested in small numbers and rats, mice, cats, and baboons (wide-ranging in Saudi Arabia and known to come into contact with humans and travel to caves possibly frequented by bats) have yet to be tested at all (Alagaili et al., 2014; Alexandersen et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014b; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013b,c) . In a large study of 1053 sera from equids (horses, donkeys and mules) from the UAE and Spain, none harboured signs of neutralising antibody against MERS-CoV (Meyer et al., 2015) .Initially, serological tools were employed and cautious analysis reported positive DCs as being seropositive to MERS-CoV, or a closely related virus (Alexandersen et al., 2014; Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013c) . Subsequently, diagnostic detection of MERS-CoV RNA and recovery of infectious virus has occurred from DC samples (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014a; Chu et al., 2014; Haagmans et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014a; Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014; Raj et al., 2014a) and from some of these, the full or majority length genomes of MERS-CoV have been sequenced Haagmans et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2014a) . These findings confirmed that DC versions of MERS-CoV were at least as similar to and just as genetically phylogentically interleaved, as were variants detected from different humans over time and across distance (Fig. 4) . Only one other animal, a Taphozous perforatus bat, has contained any traces of MERS-CoV RNA to date .Antibody screening assays sometimes detect cross-reactive antibodies in sera. These are identified as such by screening sera against likely viral culprits, for example BCoV or HCoV-OC43 (as an antigenic facsimile for BCoV). It is possible that other MERS-CoV-like viruses also reside within camels, but this would in no way detract from the current definitive characterization of identical MERS-CoV sequences found in camels.Camel screening studies have shown that juvenile DCs are more often virus or viral RNA positive while older DCs are more likely to be seropositive and RNA or virus negative or if RNA positive in the process of sero-converting, indicative of recent infection (Hemida et al., 2013 (Hemida et al., , 2014a . In adults, MERS-CoV RNA has been detected among animals with pre-existing antibody suggesting re-infection is also possible (Hemida et al., 2014a) . Viral loads among positive camels can be very high (Alagaili et al., 2014; Hemida et al., 2013 Hemida et al., , 2014a Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014) and camels have been found positive both when ill with URT respiratory signs (Adney et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014a; Hemida et al., 2014a; Memish et al., 2014f) or not obviously unwell. These findings indicate camels can host natural MERS-CoV infections. Furthermore, stored camel sera have revealed signs of MERS-CoV in camels which date back over two decades (Alagaili et al., 2014; Alexandersen et al., 2014) . Older sera have not been tested and so precisely how long camels have been afflicted by MERS-CoV, whether the virus is enzootic among them, only introduced to them 20-years ago from bats, or they are the subject of regular but short-lived viral incursions perhaps occasionally from humans themselves, cannot yet be answered. The next step was to prove a direction for infection; were DCs transmitting virus to humans or were humans infecting camels? At a Qatari site, a farm owner and his employee became ill in mid-October 2013 and tested positive for MERS-CoV RNA in a sputum and throat swab sample, respectively. RT-rtPCRs found MERS-CoV RNA in 11 of 14 positive camel nasal swabs at the farm; six (43%) met the international criteria of being positive by two or more assays . These results indicated a recent outbreak had occurred in this herd; the first indication of MERS-CoV RNA found within DCs with a temporal association to human infections. Three positive DC samples were confirmed by sequencing a 358nt portion of the S gene; these sequences were identical to each other, with close homology to other human and camel MERS-CoV sequences . The DCs and human contacts yielded ORF1a and ORF4b sequences differing by only a single nucleotide each, clustering closely with the Hafr-Al-Batin 1 2013 variant . Subsequently, another case study found evidence of a concurrent human and camel infection and the direction of that infection was inferred to be from the ill DCs and to their human owners (Azhar et al., 2014a; Drosten et al., 2014a; Memish et al., 2014f) . Partial genome sequences indicated that a human and a MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive camel had been infected by a variant of the same virus, harbouring the same distinct pattern of nucleotide polymorphisms (Memish et al., 2014f) . All nine camels in the owner's herd, serially sampled, reacted in a recombinant S1 antigen ELISA, with the two animals that had been RT-rtPCR positive showing a small, verifiable rise in antibody titre (Memish et al., 2014f) . A rise in titre theoretically begins 10-21 days after camel infection (Memish et al., 2014f) . While samples were few, the authors of this and a subsequently published study of the same farmer and camel herd in which samples were collected a few days earlier, suggested that the rise in titre in camel sera which occurred alongside a declining RNA load, while the patient was actively ill and hospitalised, indicated that the camels were infected first followed by the owner (Azhar et al., 2014a; Memish et al., 2014f) . Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) antibodies were also present and rising in one of the two RT-rtPCR positive animals but no animal's antibodies could neutralise BCoV infection (Memish et al., 2014f) .These studies show that DCs, but perhaps not one of the other animal species tested, are a reservoir for the MERS-CoV by which they seem to be often infected. Camels have been exposed to MERS-CoV, in some way, for at least two decades. It remains unknown whether isolating the reservoir would stop sporadic transmission of MERS-CoV to humans (Nishiura et al., 2014) . When three adult DCs were infected intranasally, intracheally and conjunctivally with 10 7 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV in a study in the United States, an amount similar to that shed by an infected camel, mild URT disease and mostly URT-localised virus replication resulted (Adney et al., 2014) . Infectious virus was also detected in the trachea and one of four lung lobes tested as well as in retropharyngeal, mediastinal, mesenteric, and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. URT shedding of infectious virus continued for seven days after inoculation while viral RNA could be detected for 35 days in nasal swabs. Small quantities of viral RNA, but not culturable virus, were detected in exhaled breath but no virus or viral RNA was detected in serum or whole blood and no viral RNA could be detected in faeces or urine for 42 days post inoculation (Adney et al., 2014) . A strong neutralising antibody response was produced by the camels from 14 days post inoculation.We also do not know whether camels are essential to maintaining chains of human infection which subsequently amplify into more apparent clusters and outbreaks by spreading from humanto-human. Parturition in DCs occurs in the winter months (early in the Gregorian calendar year) which may be a driver of the subsequent spike in human cases seen during 2013 and 2014 (Memish et al., 2014f) . Juvenile camels appear to host active infection more often than adult camels and this may help explain why the slaughter of camels, which must be five years of age or older, does not contribute to significantly to exposure among slaughterhouse workers (Nowotny and Kolodziejek, 2014) . Small numbers of tested DCs from Australia were not seropositive, but expanded virological investigations of Australian (a source of export) and African camels as well as bats may lead to findings of a more ancestral viral variant or more seropositive animals and geographic areas. Identifying the animal source for zoonotic spread is important to inform options for reducing human exposures Hemida et al., 2013) .The MERS-CoV genome does not appear to have changed significantly during its movement through humans in 2012-2014, nor during human and camel spillovers; human variants show very little divergence from camel MERS-CoV variants. This implies that the major source for human acquisition is the camel, rather than another animal, but more testing of other animal species is needed to support that conclusion. Over a month, a DC virus sequenced on different occasions, did not change at all genetically, indicating a high level of genomic stability and supporting the possibility that DCs might be the natural, rather than intermediate, host for MERS-CoV we know today (Hemida et al., 2014a) .The precise role for camels and the route(s) of human acquisition of MERS-CoV from camels in sporadic infections remains to be determined. Nonetheless in the absence of any other likely animal source and in the interest of public health, risk reduction activities now recommend reducing contact with camels, especially when ill, and limiting contact with camel secretions and excretions including the handling of camel milk and meat and the butchering of camels. The potential for aerosol-generation by all these procedures, yet to be defined, described or studied, has not been acknowledged in plain language as a risk to date (see Section 9.1 for aerosols and risk). Thus, camels develop signs of URT disease, shed infectious virus in high quantities in URT secretions and the possibility exists that they may aerosolise that virus.Transmission of MERS-CoV has been defined as sporadic, intrafamilial and healthcare associated (Memish et al., 2014e) . The virus was characterised because of its role in causing severe and therefore more obvious illness in humans; we were the early sentinels highlighting its incursion. Spread of MERS-CoV within families Omrani et al., 2013) and between people has been well documented ; Health Protection Agency (HPA) UK Novel Coronavirus Investigation Team, 2013; MERS, 2014b; Puzelli et al., 2013) however the first known MERS outbreak was one of acute LRT disease in a healthcare setting (Hijawi et al., 2013) . This occurred in Al-Zarqa, Jordan and was retrospectively linked to the MERS-CoV after some detailed laboratory and epidemiological analyses (Hijawi et al., 2013) . A BAL and a serum sample from two cases were found to be MERS-CoV RT-rtPCR positive and a number of probable cases were subsequently added to this outbreak (Hijawi et al., 2013) . Further investigations deployed an ELISA employing the genetically and antigenically similar btHKU5.2 recombinant nucleocapsid antigen (Chan et al., 2013c) , a MERS-CoV Hu/Jordan-N3/2012 infected Vero cell IFA, and an MNT test . These found additional cases from among the sera of 124 subjects . While serology alone does not meet the current WHO definition of a case, optimised and thoroughly validated sero-assays employed alongside good clinical histories do still identify previous occurrences of infection. Just as with PCR testing on occasion, serology usually finds a viral footprint in the absence of any clear signs and symptoms of disease (Knibbs et al., 2014) . And as is also the case with molecular testing, care is needed when moving a newly developed diagnostic serology algorithm from a research setting to one that informs public health decisions (CDC Newsroom, 2014) .For some time, testing of samples focussed on those collected from patients with severe illness and not on milder acute respiratory tract infections, nor on conducting prospective case-control studies. Contacts of confirmed MERS cases were observed for illness, but, in the absence of signs and symptoms, samples were generally not tested by a laboratory, biasing early data towards more ill and hospitalised patients; often described as just 'the tip of the iceberg'. As testing paradigms changed with increased testing of contacts, more asymptomatic and mild infections were recognised.A rise in the proportion of asymptomatic cases (which enlarges the denominator for calculations of the proportion of fatal cases (Dudley and Mackay, 2013) ) and a drop in the proportion of fatal cases (the numerator) was identified in September 2013 (Penttinen et al., 2013) . Historically, such rises are consistent with changing definitions and laboratory and clinical responses to, and understanding of, a newly discovered virus that was first noted among the severely ill. As adjustments to testing occurred, more cases of milder disease and those with subclinical infections were noted among MERS-CoV positive people. Over time there has been an apparent cyclical pattern to the average weekly age of people positive for MERS-CoV (Fig. 9A ) however the age distribution changed most notably after the Jeddah-2014 outbreak during which a shift towards younger people became evident (Fig. 9B-G) .As a group, HCWs comprised 19% of MERS-CoV detections and it is apparent from closely following publicly released case data that the weekly proportion of infected HCWs increases dramatically alongside each spike in overall detections (Fig. 10 ). This is explainable because to date, each spike has been intimately associated with healthcare-facility related outbreaks (Penttinen et al., 2013) . These spikes drive observed decreases in average age during each event because afflicted HCWs as well as families are usually younger than inpatients with MERS. Healthcare facilities have therefore been a regular target for suggested improvements aimed at bolstering weaknesses in infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures (Penttinen et al., 2013; World Health Organization, 2014f) . In May 2013, the WHO published guidelines for IPC during care of probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in a healthcare setting (World Health Organization, 2013a).The Jeddah-2014 outbreak was the largest and most rapid accumulation of MERS-CoV detections to date (Fig. 11) with April having the greatest number of MERS-CoV detections of any month on record (Fig. 11B) . The outbreak was mostly (>60% of cases) associated with human-to-human spread within hospital environments, and was thought to have resulted from a lack of, or breakdown in, IPC (Brown, 2014; Zumla and Hui, 2014) . Following the rapid increase in case numbers, a rise in fatalities ensued (Fig. 11A) .Genome sequences indicate viral change, and if the virus is well characterised, such changes may flag alterations to transmissibility, replication, lethality and response to drugs. While genetic sequences examined in 2012 and 2013 showed that multiple variants circulated among people and camels in the KSA , by comparison to the massive genome sequencing approach taken towards tracking Ebola virus transmission and evolution in west Africa during 2014 (Chan et al., 2013b) , only a handful of MERS-CoV genome sequences were reported during 2014, when the majority of all MERS-CoV detections to date occurred. The conclusions about variant diversity in 2014 are extrapolated from these relative few sequences. Those genomes from the Jeddah-2014 outbreak indicated no outstanding genetic or possibly replicative changes from earlier variants World Health Organization, 2014c) . In parallel with the Jeddah-2014 outbreak, another HCW cluster occurred in the UAE. How the index case(s) for either outbreak acquired MERS-CoV remains unknown.Genomic sequence can also be used to define the boundaries of a cluster or outbreak based on the similarity of the variants present among the infected humans and animals and at different healthcare facilities (Fig. 4) (Cotten et al., 2014) . This approach was most clearly seen when defining the geographically constrained hospital MERS outbreak in Al-Ahsa, which occurred between 1st April and 23rd May 2013, as well as clusters in Buraidah and a community outbreak in Hafr Al-Batin, KSA. Cotton et al. employed molecular epidemiology and found that there had been no sign of transmission chains extending beyond two to three months, so extensive opportunities for the virus adaptation to humans through sustained serial transmission have been infrequent (Cotten et al., 2014) . Sequencing of MERS-CoV genomes from the 2013 Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak indicated that multiple viral variants contributed to the cases but that most were similar enough to each other to be consistent with human-to-human transmission (Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Cotten et al., 2013b) . Contact tracing has been described in detail for MERS cases exported beyond the Middle East. Tracing usually identifies dozens of potential cases per confirmed case and while it is a time consuming and expensive process it is essential for understanding transmission and for containing a virus about which little is known. Eighty-three symptomatic or asymptomatic contacts of a case imported to Germany from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) harboured no sign of virus or antibody (Reuss et al., 2014) and similar examples of very limited to no onward transmission have been the hallmark of contact tracing results to date. In a study of 123 contacts of a case imported to France, only seven matched the definition for a possible case and were tested; one who had shared a 20 m 2 room while in a bed 1.5 m apart from the index case was positive and this was determined to be a nosocomial acquisition (Mailles et al., 2013) . It is possible that further mild yet positive cases may have been identified had all contacts been tested regardless of symptoms. No contacts of the first two MERS cases imported into the USA in 2014 tested positive (Bialek et al., 2014) and none among 78 contacts of two cases imported to the Netherlands develop MERS-CoV antibodies (Kraaij-Dirkzwager et al., 2014) . Apart from clearly defined case studies of nosocomial infection, nosocomial spread is also suspected among a number of MERS cases noted through analysis of public data (author's observations). These are cases admitted to hospital for support of a non-respiratory medical condition, who then develop respiratory symptoms and test positive for MERS-CoV within the incubation period of MERS-CoV infection. One example identified the likely role of a mild or asymptomatic case, present in a hospital during their admission for other reasons, as the likeliest index case for a family cluster (Omrani et al., 2013) . Such studies validate the laboratory testing of mild cases when accompanied by a process that restricts exposure of others, especially older family members and friends with underlying disease, to a MERS-CoV infected person.Infectious MERS-CoV added to camel, goat or cow milk and stored at 4 • C could be recovered at least 72 h later and, at 22 • C, for up to 48 h afterwards (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . This is in keeping with HCoV-229E being capable of retaining viability in water for 2 days up to a predicted 588 days depending on the type of water and temperature (Gundy et al., 2009) . MERS-CoV titre decreased somewhat when recovered from milk at 22 • C but pasteurization ablated MERS-CoV infectivity (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . In a subsequent study, MERS-CoV RNA was identified in the milk, nasal secretion and faeces of camels from Qatar .Plastic or steel surfaces were inoculated with 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV at 20 • C, 47% relative humidity (RH) and virus recovery was attempted in cell culture (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . At 30 • C and 80% RH, MERS-CoV remained viable for 8 h and for 24 h at 30 • C, 30% RH (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . By comparison, influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) could not be recovered in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells beyond 4 h under any conditions (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . Aerosol experiments found MERS-CoV viability decreased by 89% at 70% RH but only decreased 7% at 40% RH when an aerosol was generated at 20 • C while influenza A virus A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1) decreased by 62% and 95% respectively (van Doremalen et al., 2013) . MERS-CoV survival is inferior to that previously demonstrated by SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2011) however for context, pathogenic bacteria can remain viable for 45 min in a coughed aerosol and can spread 4 m, thus MERS-CoV's ability to remain viable over long time periods gives it the capacity to thoroughly contaminate a room occupied by an infected and symptomatic patient (Knibbs et al., 2014) . Such findings expand our understanding of the risks associated with bioaerosols for transmission of respiratory viruses in many settings, including hospital waiting rooms, emergency departments, treatment rooms, open intensive care facilities and private patient rooms. The nature and quality of air exchange, circulation and filtration is an important variable in risk measurement and reduction. Droplet spread between humans is considered the mechanism of human-to-human transmission and the need for droplet precautions has been emphasised after the Al-Ahsa hospital outbreak Assiri et al., 2013a,b; Zumla and Memish, 2014) . By extrapolation, aerosol-generating events involving camels (urination, defecation, and the processes of preparation and consumption of camel products) should be factored into risk measurement and reduction efforts and the need to define whether a more stringent level of personal protective equipment should be worn by HCWs and animal handlers remains a priority.When the MERS-CoV detection tally sat below 120, analyses of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) -the average number of infections caused by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population -returned values below 1, indicating that a pandemic was not likely (Bauch and Oraby, 2013; Breban et al., 2013; Cauchemez et al., 2014; Poletto et al., 2013) . With more data and correction for observation bias, this conclusion was maintained (Chowell et al., 2014) . These analyses reflected charting of small public data sources and indicated that while cases could climb suddenly, such as during the Al-Ahsa outbreak , the climb was not logarithmic. Methods used in these studies vary but some make allowance for more extensive case numbers than may have been publicly reported (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Poletto et al., 2013) . If R 0 was greater than 1, sustained case climb would be expected. The impact of incomplete case contact tracing, limited community testing and clinically defined cases in the absence of laboratory confirmation might affect some R 0 calculations and make it difficult to identify patterns among case occurrence. The implication is that more positives among these population groups could have occurred and thus a greater transmission efficiency and higher R 0 value may be possible. When narrowing an analysis to index cases (the case with the earliest onset date of a cluster) and inferring secondary case numbers, one study predicted that the R 0 could be slightly above 1.0 (0.8-1.3 with an upper bound of 1.2-1.5 depending on method used) (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . This study hypothesised that a high proportion of infections were not being detected (Cauchemez et al., 2014) . Similar analyses are awaited following the Jeddah-2014 outbreak.Most cases of MERS have resulted from human-to-human transmission, however that transmission was inefficient Memish et al., 2013b; Omrani et al., 2013) and defined as sporadic rather than sustained (Fig. 12) . Based on observational studies, human spread requires close contact to occur. Relevant data are scant but it appears that the majority of human cases of MERS-CoV do not transmit to more than one other human and to date, the localised epidemic of MERS-CoV has not been selfsustaining (Poletto et al., 2013) . Index or sporadic cases have been of age and sex during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak, arbitrarily defined as spanning from the week beginning 17th March 2014 and ending in the week beginning7th July 2014; data are based on laboratory confirmed cases collated into the author's curated line list as at 19th January 2015. Note the changed x-axis scale between B/C and D/E/F/G. Sources of these public data include the World Health Organization, Ministries of Health and FluTrackers (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014). Earlier and subsequent versions of this chart are maintained on a personal website (Mackay, 1997) and blog (Mackay, 2013) . (Mackay, 1997) and blog (Mackay, 2013) .older and it has yet to be established whether infections thought to have been acquired from an animal source produce a more severe outcome than those spread between humans (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . Strategic sero-assays have yet to investigate the extent to which milder or asymptomatic cases contribute to the MERS-CoV transmission chain. In a household study, 14 of 280 (5%) contacts of 26 MERS-CoV positive index patients were RNA or antibody positive .There is no specific drug or vaccine currently available to treat infection by the MERS-CoV. For context, there is still no vaccine available against SARS, mostly attributable to the brevity of the SARS-CoV global emergence. It is impossible to predict whether a MERS-CoV vaccine for human use will fall victim to a lack of commercial interest or remain relevant in the time it will take to be developed, however a vaccine for use in camels is a more practical option given the identity shared between human and camel viral variants and the apparent rarity of MERS-CoV spillover to humans. If applied to young camels ahead of their first virus acquisition, such a vaccine may be capable of eradicating MERS-CoV from herds. But if the source of camel infections is bats, newly imported camels or other herds, any vaccine would need to be used in an ongoing manner and be able to reach feral camel herds as well. Care of hospitalised patients remains supportive, with vigilance for complications (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . No empirical use of antimicrobial agents has improved severe disease nor have high dose steroids succeeded in reversing the progression of respiratory disease (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . The development and registration of drugs for human use is not suitably rapid to use effectively against an emerging infectious agent (de Wilde et al., 2014; Dyall et al., 2014) . However, research advances in this area have been made.Testing of formulations previously approved by the Food and Drug Agency (FDA; USA) at the Small-molecule Inhibitor Leads Versus Emerging and neglected RNA viruses (SILVER) project described four existing compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide and lopinavir) that inhibit MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E replication in cell culture (de Wilde et al., 2014; SILVER consortium, 2015) . In another study, 33 drugs with the ability to impart >50% inhibition upon MERS-CoV growth in culture have been described as candidates for future clinical MERS intervention studies (Dyall et al., 2014) . These were also identified following investigation of pre-existing, FDA-approved clinical drugs and encompass 13 different classes of therapeutic (Dyall et al., 2014) . A novel molecule, K22, showed promise both directly and as an example that it was possible to target and specifically disrupt very conserved viral replication processes such as double membrane vesicle-associated RNA replication, without causing cellular toxicity (Lundin et al., 2014) .Another approach has been to target the interface between the MERS-CoV RBD and the receptor by employing competitive substrates or inhibitors of the enzymatic function of DPP4 (Kawalec et al., 2014) . DPP4 inhibitors, in their role as anti-diabetes drugs, already exist, are tolerated and are not associated with adverse events (Kawalec et al., 2014) although it is unclear whether they may already be in use among MERS patients with underlying kidney disease. Additionally, targeting the viral MERS-CoV 3C protease, important for replicase polyprotein maturation, may be a viable strategy in the future because it has so far remained conserved (Cotten et al., 2014) .The company Novavax has produced an experimental recombinant nanoparticle vaccine candidate based on the MERS-CoV S protein and it has generated important anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in a mouse model (Coleman et al., 2014a) . Monoclonal antibodies (e.g. MERS-4, MERS-27 and 3B11) directed towards the S protein are capable of neutralising infection by the MERS-CoV and hold future promise for use as a therapeutic and prophylactic Tang et al., 2014) . A replication-competent, propagation-deficient E gene-deleted mutant of MERS-CoV variant EMC/2012 (rMERS-CoV-E) may also prove to be a useful vaccine candidate while a truncated RBD of MERS-CoV has been shown to elicit antibodies in mice (Almazán et al., 2013; Du et al., 2013a) . A conserved peptide in the RdRp of all HCoVs was also identified, and that may provide the basis for an epitope-directed universal vaccine (Sharmin and Islam, 2014) .IFN treatment has shown promise in culture-based experiments (MERS, 2014a) but in macaques, early application was required for effectiveness. Macaques were infected with 7 × 10 6 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV and, 8 h after infection, they were treated with substantial amounts of subcutaneous IFN-␣2b along with intravenous ribavirin, followed by ribavirin doses intramuscularly every 8 h and with IFN-␣2b every 16 h until 72 h after infection . Treatment prevented any signs of increased respiration, leucocytosis (neutrophilia) or reduction in oxygen saturation seen in the untreated animals plus treated macaques had very little to no radiographic evidence of pneumonia . The viral load in daily BALs did not differ between treated and untreated macaques but loads were reduced in the treated animal's postmortem tissues and fewer tissues were MERS-CoV RT-PCR positive. Since MERS seems to be a prolonged disease that is well engaged (Mackay, 1997) and blog (Mackay, 2013) . upon presentation for medical help, it is unclear how this drug cocktail could be delivered early enough to moderate severe disease. When trialled on five critically ill patients with comorbidities and a median time between hospitalization and treatment of 19 days (range 10-22 days), no response to treatment was evident . When used as a primary treatment of an infected physician and as prophylaxis for his wife, it was unclear whether the cocktail had any effect (Khalid et al., 2014) .The WHO took the lead in collating data and providing an official voice for the emergence of MERS from 23rd September 2012 (Hartl, 2013; World Health Organization, 2014b) . Through Global Alert and Response (GAR) Disease Outbreak News (DON) releases, the WHO kept the world updated with detailed, deidentified case information provided soon after they had been forwarded on to them from each country's Ministry of Health or equivalent, as per the transparency required by the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005. However there were often delays in the posting of such information, most notably during the Jeddah-2014 outbreak when no new case details were confirmed by the WHO as originating from KSA for more than six weeks. Cases announced via the KSA Ministry of Health website have often had data inconsistencies including errors, format variations, have often lacked key information including dates, have presented deaths with insufficient information to permit linkage with the announced case and over one hundred cases remain devoid of all key data, excluding them from most epidemiological analyses. This was a particular problem during periods when rapid case accumulation became a concern for the global community. When available, WHO DONs fill in vital missing detail, with additional important demographic data like age, sex or essential dates permitting improved understanding of when illness onset occurred, when cases were hospitalised, whether they were asymptomatic and if the newly announced case was a contact of another case, an animal or an animal product. However DONs are only effective when the underlying data is forwarded to the WHO. Such comprehensive data permits other calculations, for instance the likely laboratory turnaround time, the possibility for nosocomial spread occurring and the location of cases as a determining factor in whether a cluster has become an outbreak or a local epidemic. WHO data can be viewed by the public but are also relied upon by WHO Member States' epidemiology analysts. Such experts report to many levels of Health management and government who seek to understand threats to their own population so as to make the most informed judgements. The decisions which follow may include the need to raise alert levels, prepare laboratory capacity, create educational materials, free specific response funds, ramp up messaging, manage and alter border controls or issue travel alerts. The activities of the WHO have been essential for global preparedness against MERS. The WHO rapidly and comprehensively adopted, updated and publicly promoted diagnostic tools and testing algorithms, case definitions and guidelines for investigations, research study protocols, IPC guidance, travel advice, risk assessments and summary updates via a purpose-built coronavirus-focussed website. Their social media unit strove to answer questions posed by everyone and anyone through Twitter, which in turn allowed users to take control of further disseminating the information they found most interesting, informative, relevant or concerning to others in their social networks; a process that can also be informative to public health bodies who seek to provide their clients the detail they desire. The role of WHO as a nexus for collaboration laid the groundwork for the accumulation and advancement of knowledge about MERS and the MERS-CoV through the formation of, and reporting by, the IHR (2005) Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV. Their role is to advise the WHO Director-General on the need for action and, as yet, no Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) has been declared. The IHR Emergency Committee has met eight times to date. Upon request, the WHO has also sent risk assessment teams to the region to gauge the MERS situation. Gregory Härtl, Coordinator of the Department of Communications for the WHO, noted that 'the more answers public health experts can provide now, the greater the public's trust in these institutions will be if and when the virus should become easily transmissible between humans and cause more widespread morbidity and mortality' (Hartl, 2013) . This is a comment that applies equally well to the emergence of any infectious disease. By comparison, officials within the KSA were widely and regularly criticised for moving slowly, shunning collaborations and failing to show proactive action in commencing local research into MERS and MERS-CoV (2014c; Editorial, 2014; Holmes, 2014; Kupferschmidt, 2014; Reuters, 2014; World Health Organization, 2014f) .Despite data in the scientific literature strongly indicating that camels harboured MERS-CoV or a very closely related virus, communication about camels posing a risk to humans as the zoonotic sources for infections did not became a mainstream public health message until late April of 2014; two years after the discovery of the virus. This shift correlated with a change in the KSA Minister of Health, requests for help in containing the Jeddah-2014 outbreak and a new WHO risk assessment, which included mention of camels (World Health Organization, 2014e) . Shortly thereafter, the KSA Deputy Minister for Public Health and lead author of most peerreviewed MERS-CoV research, Professor Ziad Memish, was also asked to step down. However, the message to date, underpinned as it is by a paucity of understanding about how and from where the virus transmits, may not yet capture or adequately communicate all the risks.Much of what is considered social media is a volatile resource, yet a very valuable one. There is an understanding of the volatility of this non-peer reviewed medium but also a perception that social media is a place only for 'selfies' and not science. Tweets can disappear to search after a short period, blog pages can come and go and be untraceably altered while online mainstream news stories, in some countries more than others, may suffer similar fates as they rapidly become old news. Despite that, internet-driven information has played a vital role in rapidly tracking and unearthing cases, clusters and outbreaks of disease in recent years. This has been the case for MERS globally. At this stage, many who follow infectious disease clusters, outbreaks and pandemics through social media are well informed by exposure to a distillation of the most recent events, reports, commentary and news stories from all over the world. Professionals who use this communication medium are clearly appreciated by their funding stakeholders, the public. Social media and blogs communicate with a much broader audience than is usually reached by the traditional scientific literature and they are more accessible to the local and global communities who contribute to the funds that researchers so dearly seek. Sometimes these forms of mass communication are useful to those seeking information about a disease outbreak in their own country. Sometimes they are entirely misleading. The public audience may not spend the time and mostly do not have the background expertise to interpret the densely presented, often slow to appear, scientific and public health literature. The space between the scientific literature and mainstream media is occupied by those science communicators who may, sometimes with and sometimes without relevant scientific training, be as up-to-date on their topics as the best academic epidemiologist. The President John F. Kennedy quote, 'One person can make a difference, and everyone should try' seems an apt one to describe these dedicated people who, often without any paid incentives, devote their personal time, effort and money to better understand and communicate about infectious disease. Frequently updated data repositories such as the small FluTrackers group constantly compile, actively curate and condense worldwide news sources into threads of information that often assemble into patterns that can predict emerging infectious disease events well before they reach the mainstream media, and their line list of MERS-CoV detections (Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. 2014) has been a cornerstone of case numbering, detail and clarity; Crawford Kilian's H5N1 blog (Kilian, 2014) outstrips its name by providing links to other reliable sources as well as excerpts and highly eloquent and thought-provoking commentary on a range of microbial infectious disease stories, of which MERS-CoV is just one; Michael Coston's Avian Flu Diary (Coston, 2014 ) also focusses and comments on emerging infectious diseases augmented by astute and experienced public health commentary, resources and a large inventory of past posts that are used to good effect when creating new and informative ones; the Programme for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) is an internet-based reporting system maintained by a panel of authoritative professionals and rapporteurs who prepare daily digests of the latest infectious disease happenings which they freely circulate using widely read emails (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, 2014); for a more workforce-oriented view of MERS and infectious disease, Shane Granger's Random Analytics provides an excellent perspective of the less frequently discussed impact of infectious diseases on humans (Granger, 2012) ; my own blog, Virology Down Under seeks to distill some of the more complex virology-related happenings and present data on emerging viral disease in a more graphical, accessible and open access way (Mackay, 1997 (Mackay, , 2013 ; Maia Majumder who applies an engineering systems expertise to the epidemiology of the disease (Majumder, 2014) . These are just a few resources and each is part of an interconnected web of other sources, contacts and personal experience that exist on the internet; they have all chased and tracked the emergence of MERS-CoV as doggedly as a professional science writer. Each resource is as distinct yet complimentary source of information that together are sometimes referred to as flublogia. While it is often overlooked and perhaps underestimated by some professional scientists and clinicians, flublogia compiles or uses publicly available, deidentified data and adds publicly relevant interpretation which is greatly appreciated, much more widely read and far, far more often cited than anything seen in the professional scientific literature. It is also a factual source of such information Salathe et al., 2013) .The MERS-CoV appears to be an entrenched camel virus infecting the URT which may have its origins among bats. Human infection may result from rare zoonotic spillover to humans. Many potential animal, human and environmental sources await further testing but thanks to quick action, the sensitive and rapid molecular diagnostic tools required to achieve this goal have been in place and available since the virus was made known to the public. Serological tools for research application, after a much slower start, are now emerging as robust, validated and ready for wider use, with care. Commercial unavailability remains an issue for more widespread use and so collaboration with the relevant research groups must be the immediate option for future studies. The MERS-CoV can spread from human-to-human but seems to do so only sporadically and sustained chains of transmission have not been evident to date. There is also no evidence that MERS-CoV is a virus of pandemic concern, despite many opportunities for it to become so. But vigilance is key for a virus with a genetic makeup that has only been observed for three years. Of those known to be infected, over a third have died. Central to future vigilance is continued screening, sequencing, analysis and timely data sharing. While whole genome sequencing has been used extensively to study MERS-CoV, it remains a tool for experts and collaborations have again been key for less equipped or experienced researchers to decode the MERS-CoV as it moves through people, over time and across distance in the KSA and beyond its borders. A recently described routine genotyping target which is equivalently informative will also aid this vigilance. Nonetheless, figures modelling efficiency of transmission will need confirmation once better serological and RT-rtPCR-based studies of humans, covering more of the community, have been conducted. It has become very clear that the MERS-CoV may spread poorly from human-to-human, but that spread is at its most effective around a hospital environment. Indications are that this can be traced back to poor IPC practices and protocols (Brown, 2014; Editorial, 2014; Zumla and Hui, 2014) . The virus has its greatest impact on those with underlying diseases and such cases, sometimes suffering multiple comorbidities, are likely to visit hospital for treatment, creating a perfect storm of exposure, transmission and mortality. Educational programmes will be important tools to combat the spread of MERS-CoV. While MERS and SARS have some similarities they also diverge significantly. Characteristics including the higher PFC among MERS cases (above 50% in 2013 and currently at 30-40%; well above the 9.5% of SARS), the association between fatal disease and older males with underlying comorbidities, the very broad tropism of MERS-CoV, its rapid in vitro growth, rapid induction of cytopathogenic change, robust yet distinct transcriptional responses, use of a different receptor, its induction of a more proinflammatory but reduced and delayed innate antiviral response and its sensitivity to external IFN␣ or IFN␤ all signal differences from SARS-CoV to some degree.MERS has had little direct impact on populations outside the Arabian Peninsula with relatively few cases acquired outside the KSA to date. From those studies conducted thus far that screen people beyond the most severely ill, there appears to be a 2-3% prevalence of MERS-CoV in the KSA with a 5% chance of secondary transmission within the household. Despite two mass gatherings that have afforded the virus many millions of opportunities to spread, there have, remarkably, been no reported outbreaks of MERS or MERS-CoV during or immediately after these events. Nonetheless, hospitals across the KSA continue to describe MERS cases and so the other 22 countries who have experienced MERS and the rest of the world remain on alert for imported cases, especially during and after mass gathering events including Umrah, Ramadan and Hajj pilgrimages.Much remains unknown about MERS-CoV and MERS. Further cooperative data-sharing and research is needed to address questions which include:• What is the natural host for the MERS-CoV?• Are camels the source of sporadic human infections and if so, why is MERS-CoV seroprevalence among humans working closely with camels, so low? • What is the route of transmission to humans and between humans and what is the best personal protective equipment to be adopted by frontline HCWs? • Which hospital IPC measures are insufficient or insufficiently employed to halt the transmission of MERS-CoV and what is the extent of transmission and clinical impact of, and nosocomial infection by, other co-occurring respiratory viruses in these settings in the KSA? • Why are males more often afflicted than females? Are there differences in activity and exposure that could explain this? What is the prevalence of underlying disease between the sexes? • Does MERS-CoV infection generally result in a subclinical outcome except in those with comorbidities? • Do current serological tools have the sensitivity to detect the immune response to a mild, subclinical or asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection? If not, might MERS-CoV be a rare, seasonal and endemic infection of humans like other HCoVs? • For how long does the average period of MERS-CoV shedding continue from infected humans and does this differ with age, sex and vocation? • March and April seem to be when human outbreaks of MERS begin-what are the events occurring in and around this time of year that may increase human exposure to MERS-CoV? • Why does MERS-CoV continue to affect such a wide area of the KSA but in such very low numbers-is there an as-yet-unidentified role for mass gatherings in virus acquisition and subsequent geographic dissemination? • What proportion of acute respiratory tract disease cases continue to go untested because they do not manifest as severe disease and could these clarify gaps in the transmission chains of some cases? • Have cases of MERS been going undiagnosed among people in African countries that are known to host seropositive or viruspositive camels? • Are there divergent MERS-CoV variants and viral clades to be found in camels, humans and bats beyond the Arabian peninsula?The localised MERS-CoV epidemic reminds us of the importance of communication at all levels and perhaps the need to rethink how stakeholders are informed of the progress of chasing down and studying new disease threats. In May 2014, two cases of MERS-CoV were imported into the USA. A third person was proposed to be the first local transmission event but was subsequently declared a false-positive. These cases served as an excellent example of 'gumshoe epidemiology' working alongside excellent public communication, comprehensive laboratory support and a well-prepared clinical capacity. Social and mainstream media and press conferences comprehensively informed the public of the extensive findings generated by expert health care supported by laboratory analysis. And yet lessons were still learned about balancing real-time transparency and the need for suitable laboratory confirmation of results. This case highlighted the effectiveness of social media in communicating digestible information to expectant stakeholders compared to the use of a generally slower and more elite peer-reviewed scientific publication pipeline which is often better suited to detailed research description over the long haul, but with some exceptions, a process unsuited for informing a concerned global and always-online public of potential threats to its immediate health or providing context to those threats.However, while MERS-CoV is not a rapidly spreading global contagion, it may evolve further to become that or another may emerge in the future and vigilance and rapid communication will be key to a timely response and early containment. Every time a new virus emerges, we learn more, requiring us to re-examine what we previously 'knew'. One constant in all this however is the human; it is we who fan the flames of a disease cluster until it becomes an outbreak, epidemic or pandemic. Viruses do not emerge and gain a foothold without our aid, or our lapses in vigilance. MERS highlighted that some paradigms can be stumbling blocks to seeking and communicating knowledge and containing and understanding the spread and nature of a virus. It also served as yet another reminder to us that global human and animal health, politics, agriculture and economies are all intimately interwoven and it takes just a single tiny virus to tip a very fine balance."}, {"qas" : [{"question":"What is the structure of the virus?", "id": "0a00a6df208e068e7aa369fb94641434ea0e6070", "is_impossible": false}], "context" : "Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis and is the only available vaccine against tuberculosis (TB). Since 1974, BCG vaccination has been included in the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunization. It is estimated that more than 3 billion individuals have been immunized with BCG and over 100 million doses of BCG are administered annually. Multiple studies have confirmed that BCG is generally safe and can protect children against disseminated disease, including tuberculosis meningitis [1, 2] . BCG also provides cross-protection against leprosy [3] . However, the success of BCG against pulmonary TB in adults is still debated, since randomized clini-cal trials have reported protection efficacy ranging from 0-80% [4, 5] . Several hypotheses for the variation in observed efficacy have been proposed [6] [7] [8] [9] .One explanation concerns the heterogeneity of the BCG strains [6] . The original BCG was derived from a virulent strain of M. bovis isolated from a cow. From 1908 through 1921, this isolate was subjected to 230 passages on glycerinated potato bile medium, which generated an attenuated strain termed BCG [10] . Distribution and widespread use of BCG started around 1924 and was accompanied by changes in the manufacturing process in production facilities. For instance, while BCG in Sweden was transferred without interruption from bile potato to bile potato medium in accordance with Calmette's original practice [11] , BCG production in Denmark involved alternating rounds of growth on potato bile medium and Sauton broth until 1949 when it was grown exclusively in Sauton medium [12] . Prior to the establishment of seed stocks in the 1960s, BCG was passaged continuously, and the changes in media and transfer schedules contributed to the 'in vitro evolution' of BCG [6] . It is estimated that as many as 49 production substrains have been used at one time or another in various parts of the world [13] , including the four major BCG vaccines in current use (BCG-Pasteur, -Danish, -Glaxo, and -Japan) [14] . The relative protective efficacy of BCG substrains is currently unknown [6, 15] .Anecdotal reports have long indicated that BCG substrains exhibit phenotypic differences in growth characteristics, biochemical activities, ability to protect against challenge with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and residual virulence [16] . Over the past decade, numerous groups have sought to identify the genomic changes responsible for these phenotypes. The earliest whole genome comparisons confirmed that BCG was indeed related to, but distinct from M. tb and M. bovis [17] [18] [19] . Subsequent analyses of multiple vaccine strains have uncovered extensive genome diversity including both deletions and duplications in BCG substrains [18, [20] [21] [22] . The phylogeny established by these molecular methods is consistent with the historical records of BCG dissemination [20, 23, 24] . For example, BCG strains acquired after 1927 exhibit the RD2 deletion, while nRD18 is only deleted in strains obtained after 1933. Other genomic changes are exclusive to individual daughter strains, and are associated with vaccine production at specific locations [22, 24] .A number of molecular techniques have been used to investigate genomic polymorphisms in BCG strains. Early efforts using subtractive hybridization [18] and spotted oligonucleotide arrays [20, 22, 25] effectively identified large sequence polymorphisms, but lacked the resolution to identify smaller changes. More recently, complete genome sequencing has enabled high-resolution analysis of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 [24] , but sequences for other BCG lineages have yet to be determined. To identify potential genomic polymorphisms in other BCG substrains, we have employed a tiling array platform developed by Nim-bleGen Systems. This DNA microarray-based comparative genome sequencing technique allows high resolution detections of sequence polymorphisms [26] [27] [28] . Using this technique, in tandem with DNA resequencing, we have identified a number of novel genomic polymorphisms in BCG strains. Importantly, these polymorphisms affect genes that are known virulence factors and are expected to have a major impact on the immunogenicity and efficacy of individual vaccine strains.We have used NimbleGen tiling arrays to analyze the genomic variability of 13 BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau, -Sweden, -Birkhaug, -China, -Prague, -Glaxo, -Danish, -Tice, -Phipps, -Frappier and -Pasteur. All of these strains, except BCG-China, have previously been subjected to genomic analysis by other methods [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . The complete genome sequence of BCG-Pasteur 1173P2 is available [24] . The same BCG-Pasteur strain was included in the analysis to serve as an internal control for our experiments in addition to validating the NimbleGen technique. In each experiment, genomic DNA from M. tb H37Rv [29] acted as the common referent.A total of 42 deletions were identified. Twenty-five of these have been described previously [18, 20, 22, 24, 25] . Thirteen more represent transposons (e.g., IS6110) present in the referent strain (M. tb H37Rv), but absent from the M. bovis and BCG lineages [24, 29, 30] . Six duplications were identified, four (DU1, DU2-I, -II, -III) of which have been described previously [21, 24] . These results confirm the validity of our approach, and the utility of tiling arrays for comparative genomics. A total of 4 novel deletions and 2 duplications were identified in our analysis. These novel deletions and duplications are described below.Two deletions specific to BCG-Moreau were identified. The first is a 975 bp deletion ( Table 1 ) that eliminates the distal end of fadD26 (Rv2930/BCG2952) and the start of ppsA (Rv2931/BCG2953). These genes are part of the genetic locus required for the biosynthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) [31] , two cell wall lipids known to be important for the virulence of M. tb and M. bovis [32] [33] [34] . In previous work, we demonstrated that BCG-Moreau does not pro-duce PDIMs or PGLs [35] , which is now explained by the fadD26-ppsA deletion identified in the current study.The second novel polymorphism in BCG-Moreau is an 1128 bp deletion within Rv3887c/BCG3942c (Table 1) . Although intact in other BCG substrains, this region overlaps with a 2.4-kb deletion (termed RDpan) found in some M. bovis strains [36] , including the sequenced strain, AF2122/97 [30] . The Rv3887c/BCG3942c gene encodes a membrane transport protein and is part of the ESX-2 type VII secretion system [37] . The role of the ESX-2 system in virulence is unknown considering its variable presence among clinical M. bovis isolates from both France and England [36] . However, loss of the Rv3887c membrane transporter likely eliminates the secretion of ESAT-6-and CFP-10-like antigens [37] and influences the immunogenicity of the vaccine strain.Two novel deletions were identified in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug. These polymorphisms are identical between the two BCG strains, which is consistent with their genealogy [24] . The first deletion comprises 110 bp and disrupts the promoter and translational start site of whiB3 (Rv3416/BCG3486) [see Additional file 1]. The other is a 245 bp deletion within trcR (Rv1033c/ BCG1091c) ( Table 1 ). Both genes encode transcriptional regulators known to impact virulence.WhiB3 belongs to a family of seven M. tb transcriptional regulatory proteins that contain iron-sulfur clusters and are predicted to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli [38] . WhiB3 responds to oxygen and nitric oxide, and is important for regulation of carbon metabolism [39] . The deletion of whiB3 in M. bovis attenuates in vivo growth in guinea pigs [40] . TrcR is the response regulator of the TrcR-TrcS two-component system. Deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype such that the strain exhibits increased lethality in SCID mice [41] .Although the genomic profiles of BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Sweden are similar, we have also found that BCG-Birkhaug is distinguished by a strain-specific duplication, named DU-Birkhaug. This spans the origin of replication and is analogous to the DU1 duplication in BCG-Pasteur [21, 24] (Fig. 1A) . However, the borders of the DU-Birkhaug are different. Whereas DU1 encompasses 29.6 kb from Rv3910 to pknB/Rv0014, DU-Birkhaug spans a slightly different region, from trxB/Rv3913 to rodA/ Rv0017c. Most of the genes in these regions are involved with DNA replication and cell division. Unlike DU1, DU-Birkhaug also appears to be in a genomic location distant to its original copy. Initial PCR-based attempts to characterize the boundaries of this duplication assumed that the second copy was nearby failed to detect a product (data not shown). As such, the genome location of DU-Birkhaug remains unknown.Our analysis also revealed a novel duplication in the genome of BCG-Tice termed DU-Tice. It comprises a 22kb duplication that encompasses Rv1782-Rv1800 (Fig.  1B ). The precise boundaries and location of this duplication were determined using primers at the junction (Fig.  1C) . Interestingly, DU-Tice encodes the ESX-5 secretion system [37, 42] . This includes several conserved membrane transporters (Rv1782, Rv1783, Rv1795, and Rv1797), a membrane associated ATPase (Rv1784), a set of PE/PPE genes (Rv1787-Rv1792) and the ESAT-6 and CFP-10 family proteins (esxM and esxN) [37] . ESX-5 is absent from the genome of the fast-growing, non-pathogenic M. smegmatis, but present in both the M. avium complex and M. marinum. The role of ESX-5 in virulence has been demonstrated in M. marinum [37, 42] . It has been suggested that the ESX clusters evolved via gene duplication [43] and DU-Tice offers the first snapshot of such an event.To our knowledge, we have conducted the first genomic analysis of BCG-China, which is a descendant of BCG-Danish obtained from the Statens Serum Institut around 1947. Consistently, BCG-China exhibits the DU2-III duplication and deletion of RD2 (data not shown), which is similar to other BCG-Danish derivatives, including BCG-Prague (obtained in 1946 from passage 725) [44] , The coordinates correspond to the genome of M. tb H37Rv. The two deletions and DU-Tice were confirmed by PCR application and DNA sequencing.Novel duplications identified in BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Tice by NimbleGen tiling array Figure 1 Novel duplications identified in BCG-Birkhaug and BCG-Tice by NimbleGen tiling array. Sections of the ratio plot are shown. The ratio of the reference (M. tb H37Rv) probe intensity (Cy5) was divided by the test (BCG strain) probe intensity (Cy3). Reference probes and test probes that do not span a mutation should represent full-length perfect match hybridization, and thus should have similar intensities, with a reference/test ratio near 1. If the test genome contains an amplification event (increased copy number when compared to the reference), then the reference/test ratio will shift below 1. (A) Novel duplication (DU-Birkhaug) identified in BCG-Birkhaug, which is analogous to the DU-Pasteur (DU1) but has different borders. The same genomic region of BCG-Sweden, which is closely related to BCG-Birkhaug, is shown for comparison. (B) Novel duplication (DU-Tice) identified in BCG-Tice. Three other BCG strains belonging to the same group (DU2-IV) are shown for comparison. (C) The precise border of DU-Tice is mapped by PCR amplification using primers specific to the junction. The two copies are immediately adjacent to each other and overlap by 1 bp.BCG-Glaxo (obtained in 1954, from passage 1077) and BCG-Danish (lyophilized in 1961, from passage 1331) [45] . However, BCG-China and -Prague do not contain the previously described deletion of Rv1810, which is characteristic of BCG-Glaxo and -Danish. As such, the Rv1810 deletion must have occurred between 1947 and 1954. Coincidentally, this period corresponds to the replacement of potato bile medium by Sauton medium for BCG production in Denmark [12] .The PhoP-PhoR system is one of the 11 two-component systems found in the M. tb genome [29] . The PhoR protein is a transmembrane histidine kinase that transmits signals from the environment by autophosphorylation. The phosphoryl group is then transferred to PhoP, a response regulator that regulates the expression of multiple genes [46] . Recently, several studies have demonstrated that the PhoP-PhoR system, particularly PhoP, plays an essential role in M. tb virulence [26, [46] [47] [48] . A single point mutation (S219L) in the DNA binding region of PhoP partially accounts for the attenuation of the H37Ra strain of M. tb [26] . Furthermore, a phoP mutant of M. tb was found to be more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur in SCID mice infections [47] . Our NimbleGen analysis revealed some weak signals in the phoP-phoR region (not shown), which prompted us to resequence these genes. The DNA fragment containing the promoter region of phoP, the ORFs of phoP and phoR, and the intergenic region was PCR amplified from each BCG strain and determined by DNA sequencing.Our sequence analysis revealed a number of polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus in various BCG strains compared to the genome sequence of M. bovis. The three early BCG substrains, BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau, contain an identical IS6110 (1,356 bp) insertion at nucleotide 851593 of the M. tb genome, which is 18 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP (Fig. 2) . This IS6110 element is identical to many other copies of IS6110 found in various locations in the M. tb genome. It is flanked by a 3-bp direct repeat (GAA) on both sides and is in an inverse orientation of phoP-phoR (Fig. 2) . The presence of an IS6110 element in the promoter region of phoP in BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau has been described previously, but its insertion site and orientation were not determined until now [49] . Although not present in M. tb H37Rv or M. bovis AF2122/97, an IS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter was found in a clinical strain of M. bovis termed B strain, which was responsible for a severe nosocomial outbreak of multidrug resistant TB in humans in Spain [50, 51] . However, unlike the three BCG strains, the IS6110 insertion in the M. bovis B strain is located at 75 bp upstream of the start codon of phoP and is in the same orientation as phoP-phoR [50] . The potential effect of IS6110IS6110 insertion in the phoP promoter in BCG-Russia, -Moreau, and -Japan on phoP expression is described in the 'Discussion' section.Three other novel phoP-phoR polymorphisms that likely impact their functions were also uncovered by our sequencing analysis. An identical, 11-bp deletion within the ORF of phoR was uncovered in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug (ACCGGACTGGG, nucleotides from 853689 to 853699, M. tb genome coordinates). This deletion changes the amino acid sequence of 54 residues (residues 432 to 485) in the C-terminal of PhoR. This polymorphism is different than the previously described 10 bp deletion within phoR present in BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo, which affects residues 91-485 [24] . BCG-Frappier also contains a single nucleotide deletion (A at 852701, M. tb genome coordinates), causing a frame-shift mutation that affect residues 103-485 of PhoR. Together, these results indicate that besides BCG-Danish and BCG-Glaxo, BCG-Sweden, -Birkhaug, and -Frappier also contain a defective phoR gene.A single nucleotide insertion within the ORF of phoP was uncovered in BCG-Prague (G, between nucleotides 852067 and 852068, M. tb genome coordinates) [see Additional file 2]. This frame shift mutation changes the C-terminal sequence (residues 154-247) of PhoP, which is the DNA binding domain (residues 144-247) [52] [53] [54] .As such, BCG-Prague is a natural phoP mutant.Single point mutations in PhoP or PhoR are also found in various BCG strains and are summarized in Table 2 . In contrast, sequences of the phoP-phoR locus of BCG-Phipps, -Tice, and -Pasteur are identical to the published sequence of BCG-Pasteur and M. bovis [24, 30] .The loss of the RD1-encoded ESX-1 protein secretion system during 1908-1921 contributes to the attenuation of BCG ( [55] , see also Fig. 3) . However, because reintroduction of ESX-1 into BCG does not restore full virulence, other genetic lesions are also involved [56] . As such, some strains are more virulent than others in animal models of infection [57] and also exhibit differential ability to induce adverse reactions (reactogenicity) following vaccination in neonates [58] . Our current work begins to provide some explanation for these observed differences (Fig. 3) .Consistent with a previous study [58] , we find that the earliest distributed BCG strains, BCG-Russia, -Japan, and -Moreau, all contain a second copy of IS6110 that is inserted in the promoter region of phoP. A similar, albeit distinct, insertion of IS6110 in the phoP promoter was also found in a virulent strain called M. bovis B strain [50] . The presence of IS6110, which is in the same orientation as phoP, increases the expression of phoP and (the resulting [30] . BCG-Danish and -Glaxo contains a 10 bp deletion within phoR, which was described previously [24] . ND: polymorphisms not detected. NA: no affect.increase in virulence) was thought to be responsible for the outbreak of M. bovis B strain in humans [50] . Similarly, the expression level of phoP was found to be higher in BCG-Japan than in BCG-Pasteur [24] . However, in BCG-Japan, -Russia, and -Moreau, the IS6110 is in the inverse orientation of phoP (Fig. 2 ). As such, how IS6110 upregulates phoP expression in BCG is not immediately apparent and likely involves a different mechanism. One possibility is the elimination of phoP autoregulation. It was shown that PhoP protein, albeit from H37Ra, binds to three 9-bp direct repeats within the phoP promoter sequence and represses its own expression [52] . In BCG, IS6110 is inserted between the PhoP binding sites and the start codon of phoP, which could impair the repression by PhoP and subsequently increase phoP expression. Alternatively, an unidentified promoter sequence within IS6110 in the same orientation of phoP could drive the expression of phoP. The presence of the second copy of IS6110 in these early BCG strains also suggests that the original BCG isolated in 1921 might have been derived from a highly virulent M. bovis strain containing the same IS6110 element. This IS6110 was subsequently lost in other BCG strains (Fig. 3) and is not present in most clinical strains of M. bovis and M. tb isolated in modern times [50, 59] .Given the important role of PhoP in M. tb virulence, higher expression of phoP could explain why BCG-Russia is generally considered more virulent than other BCG strains [6] . However, in the other early strains, BCG-Moreau and BCG-Japan, the loss of lipid virulence factors PDIMs and PGLs appears to have a more pronounced effect on virulence. Consequently, these two strains, together with BCG-Glaxo, which also lacks PDIMs and PGLs, and as we have described previously, are more attenuated and less reactogenic than other BCG strains [35] . The deletion of fadD26-ppsA described here provides a genetic mechanism for the defective PDIM/PGL biosynthesis in BCG-Moreau. However, this region is intact in BCG-Japan and BCG-Glaxo, indicating that other mechanisms may also lead to the PDIM/PGL defect.BCG-Sweden was obtained from the Institut Pasteur in 1926 while Konrad Birkhaug acquired the strain that bears his name around 1927 [6] . Previous studies indicated that these strains differ from other early BCG strains (i.e., BCG-Russia, -Japan, -Moreau) only by the loss of the IS6110 element described above. Our current work reveals three novel deletions shared by BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug (Fig. 3) , which distinguish them from other early strains. Two deletions affect the regulatory proteins WhiB3 and TrcR, and have different impacts on virulence.The whiB3 gene appears to be important for virulence. The M. bovis whiB3 mutant is attenuated for growth in guinea pigs but not in mice [40] . Conversely, the trcRS two-component system has a negative impact on virulence. Deletion of trcS from M. tb generates a hypervirulent phenotype in SCID mice [41] . BCG-Sweden was used in Sweden from 1926 until 1978 and was then replaced by BCG-Danish because of the high frequency of osteitis associated with the former strain [60] . The deletion of trcR may contribute to the reactogenicity of BCG-Sweden. Figure 3 Refined genealogy of BCG vaccines. The genealogy is modified from a previous model [24] . Genetic markers identified in this work are highlighted.The other deletion found in BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug affects the phoR gene of the phoP-phoR two-component system. Remarkably, three other late BCG strains, BCG-Danish, -Glaxo, and -Frappier also contain a defective phoR gene. Together a total of five BCG strains are natural phoR mutants. However, three distinct mutations are found among these five strains, which correspond to their genealogy (Fig. 3) . The role of phoR in virulence is less understood than for phoP. Among its many functions, phoP is required for the biosynthesis of trehalose-containing cell wall lipids [48, 61, 62] . Contrastingly, phoR does not seem to be required for this function [62] . Nevertheless, the fact that the phoR mutation has been acquired by different groups of BCG strains by three independent events and genetic mechanisms suggests that there was a common selective pressure and an important role for this gene during the in vitro evolution of BCG.Another BCG strain that contains a major mutation in the phoP-phoR system is BCG-Prague. A single nucleotide insertion in the ORF of phoP changes the C-terminal sequence, which contains the DNA binding domain of PhoP [52] [53] [54] . As such, BCG-Prague is a natural phoP mutant and likely to be more attenuated than other BCG strains. This is consistent with the study by Lagranderie et al., which showed in mice models of infection that BCG-Prague exhibited more attenuated phenotypes compared to three other BCG strains (BCG-Russia, -Pasteur, and -Glaxo) [57] . Compared to 11 other BCG strains, including BCG-Russia, -Moreau, -Japan, -Sweden, -Danish, -Glaxo, and -Pasteur that have been analyzed in the current study, BCG-Prague consistently exhibited the weakest ability to induce delayed type hypersensitivity to tuberculin in children [63] or in guinea pig models [64] . Because of the traditional presumption that tuberculin reactivity is associated with vaccine potency, BCG-Prague, which was used in Czechoslovakia between 1951-1980 and appeared to be effective, was replaced by BCG-Russia in 1981 [58] . An immediate increase of BCG-induced osteitis cases was observed in Czechoslovakia following the switch of BCG-Prague to BCG-Russia [65] . The phoP mutation detected in the current study may explain the weak tuberculin sensitivity induced by BCG-Prague. It was recently shown that a phoP mutant of M. tb was more attenuated than BCG-Pasteur and confers an equivalent protection in mice against M. tb challenge. In the guinea pig model, the M. tb phoP mutant showed superior protection to BCG-Pasteur against a high dose challenge with M. tb [47] . Consequently, the M. tb phoP mutant is now being evaluated as a vaccine candidate to replace BCG [66] . Since BCG-Pasteur contains an intact phoP gene, and in light of our finding, it would be worthy to compare the M. tb phoP mutant with BCG-Prague in terms of safety and protective efficacy.The novel duplication uncovered in BCG-Tice (DU-Tice) may have an impact on its residual virulence and immunogenicity. DU-Tice contains the entire ESX-5 secretion system, which is one of the five type VII secretion systems found in the M. tb complex [37] . Importantly, besides the RD1-encoded ESX-1, ESX-5 is the only other ESX system that has been shown to be involved in virulence thus far [37] . ESX-5 is conserved in other pathogenic mycobacteria and reported to facilitate the cell-to-cell spread of M. marinum in infected macrophages, a function shared by ESX-1 [42] . However, ESX-5 does not complement the loss of virulence caused by ESX-1 deletion, suggesting that they play distinct roles in virulence [37] . Horwitz and co-workers have used BCG-Tice as the host strain to overexpress antigen 85B. This resulted in a recombinant strain termed rBCG30 that exhibits superior protective efficacy over BCG-Tice and is currently being evaluated as a vaccine candidate in human clinical trials [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . The rBCG30 Tice strain also showed significantly stronger immune response and better protection against M. tb challenge than the rBCG30 strain based on BCG-Connaught [69] .The duplication of ESX-5 in BCG-Tice, which could increase the residual virulence and immunogenicity, may partially account for the benefit associated with rBCG30 Tice.Our current work has uncovered six large sequence polymorphisms not described previously, including two deletions exclusive to BCG-Moreau, two deletions shared by BCG-Sweden and BCG-Birkhaug, as well as the DU-Birkhaug and DU-Tice duplications. Moreover, we have uncovered a number of polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus in various BCG strains. Remarkably, these polymorphisms affect genes that are well known to have major impact on the virulence of M. tb or M. bovis. These include genes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid virulence factors PDIMs/PGLs, genes that encode the ESX family type VII secretion system, and the phoP-phoR two-component regulatory system. [72] . In addition, a mutant of M. bovis deficient in PDIMs/PGLs is being considered as a vaccine to protect wildlife against bovine tuberculosis [73] . Our previous study [35] and current work provide direct evidence that BCG vaccine strains are different in major virulence factors, and likely have different vaccination properties including safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Since new vaccine candidates are evaluated for their vaccination properties relative to BCG, the appropriate choice of BCG strain for these studies is critical. Furthermore, because it is likely that BCG will continue to play a role in tuberculosis control by being included in forthcoming clinical trials, as either a primer to be boosted by new components (e.g. subunit or DNA vaccine) or as an integral component (e.g. recombinant BCG) of new vaccines, greater attention must be given to the benefits that a particular strain may -or may notoffer.The mycobacterial strains used in this study were: Mutation mapping microarrays were designed with Nim-bleGen algorithms that select a 29-mer oligonucleotide every 7 bases on each strand of the reference genome sequence (Genbank Accession AL123456) [29] . All probes were synthesized in parallel on a four-array set using a Digital Light Processor™ (Texas Instruments, Plano Texas) and photoprotected by phosphoramidite chemis-try (Maskless Array Synthesis) (NimbleGen Systems, Madison WI) in a random probe layout [74, 75] .Labeled genomic DNA was hybridized to arrays in the NimbleGen Hybridization Buffer at 42°C for 16 hr using a MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro Systems, Inc. Salt Lake City, Utah). Labeled genomic DNA (5 μg) from the reference strain M. tb H37Rv and from each BCG strain were co-hybridized to each array. Arrays were washed with NimbleGen wash buffer, and were then spun dry in a microarray high-speed centrifuge (TeleChem International, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and stored until scanned.Microarrays were scanned at 5 μm resolution using the Genepix ® 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City CA), and pixel intensities were extracted using NimbleS-can™ v2.4 software (NimbleGen). Probes that spanned potential mutations were identified by NimbleGen software. Probe sequences corresponding to all possible candidate mutation sites were selected for resequencing. The strategy that was used to automatically generate the sequencing array is similar to that described previously [28] . Briefly, 8 probes per base position were analyzed, 4 per genome strand. These probes contain all possible alleles at a centrally located position. The length, melting temperature and mismatch position of each probe were optimized. When target DNA is hybridized to these arrays the perfectly matched probe will hybridize more strongly than the three corresponding mismatched probes for each strand. The differential signal intensity between the perfectly matched probe and mismatched probes allows the base to be determined precisely. These resequencing arrays were synthesized, hybridized with labeled genomic DNA from each BCG strain and scanned as above. Sequence base assignments were made using a machinelearning algorithm [76] . Putative mutation-containing DNA segments were PCR amplified and verified by capillary sequencing [see Additional file 3].

Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), which is encoded by the var gene family comprising approximately 60 members, is the major virulence factor involved in the antigenic variation and clinical pathogenicity of falciparum malaria [4, 5] . It is remarkable that the expression of var family members is mutually exclusive. For each parasite at a time, only one or a few var genes are expressed, while the remaining members are silenced [6, 7] . In each generation, P. falciparum is able to express different var genes, and the switches in var gene expression lead to antigenic variation of PfEMP1, which results in immune evasion and chronic infection [8] [9] [10] [11] . This process has proven to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, including chromatin modification, nuclear architecture and gene relocation [12, 13] .It has been shown that the single active var gene is enriched in euchromatic modifications, such as histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) and histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), particularly near the transcriptional start site (TSS) [14] , while the silent var genes are usually enriched in the heterochromatin marker (histone 3 lysine9 trimethylation, H3K9me3) in the 5'UTR or the coding sequence [14] [15] [16] [17] . In this process, histone modifying enzymes such as PfMYST, PfGCN5, PfSIR2 and PfSET, have been considered important for epigenetic control of reversible histone modifications, according to previous studies [12, 13] . PfMYST, a putative histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in P. falciparum, is capable of acetylating multiple lysines on H4 [18, 19] , while an orthologue of the yeast HAT PfGCN5 influences acetylation of H3K9 and K14, both are essential marks of gene activation [18, 20] . Two paralogues of the class III HDAC (histone deacetylases) Sir2, play key roles in maintaining heterochromatin and mutually exclusive var gene expression [15, 21, 22] . PfSir2A deacetylates H3K9ac, H3K14ac and H4K16ac [23] , and is more important in silencing subtelomeric var genes such as upsA-, upsEand upsC-subtype vars. In contrast, PfSir2B silences upsB vars [22] . Furthermore, a total of ten P. falciparum histone lysine methyltransferases (HKMTs) belonging to the SET domain family have been found in P. falciparum [18, 24, 25] . PfSET10 localizes to a specialized region at the nuclear periphery with the active vars such as H3K4me4 transferase [26] .Plasmodium falciparum variant-silencing SET gene (PfSETvs) controls the H3K36me3 on var genes (silencing var genes) [27] . Moreover, subnuclear architecture contributes to the regulation of var gene expression [13] .var genes are by default silent since they are located at the nuclear periphery [28] . However, active var promoters seem to occupy a privileged expression site of this region, making it permissive to transcribe [21] . PF11_0091, an ApiAP2 member, binds a conserved motif in var introns, mediates episomal anchoring towards the nuclear periphery, and recruiting an actin protein complex and polymerized nuclear actin de-represses silent var genes [29] .On the other hand, various trans factors are intimately involved in regulating chromatin structure and gene activity. PfAlbas contribute to heterochromatin structure and regulation of var gene expression [30] . PfSIP2, another ApiAP2 member, is involved in the recruitment and organization of subtelomeric heterochromatin through binding to SPE2 [31] , and induces a comprehensive silencing of a var promoter. Particularly, four major classes of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers had been found in P. falciparum, facilitating the spatial and temporal remodeling of chromatin [13] . All these remodeler families consist of a SWI2/SNF2family ATPase subunit featuring an ATPase domain [32, 33] , which includes an HSA (helicase-SANT), a post-HSA, and a C-terminal bromodomain. Some other conserved subunits carry extra conserved domains, such as hBAF155/170 (SANT, SWIRM), hBAF60 (SWIB) and human polybromo (multiple bromodomains). BAF60b is generally known as SWI-B or SWIB, an alternative form of the SWI/SNF complex (Complex B) [34] , while human BAF60a protein of SWI/SNF complex is responsible for facilitating cell cycle halting and has the ability to tune the balance between repair and apoptosis induction [35] [36] [37] . Recently, a SWI/ SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, PfSWIB (GenBank: PF3D7_0611400), which is characterized by its SWIB/MDM2 domain (SWI complex, BAF60b domain), has been identified in P. falciparum. PfSWIB might trigger stage-specific PCD by which transient nuclear localization causes removal of these parasites [38] . Further studies revealed that PfSWIB was not only crucial for the survival and growth of the parasite, but also had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins [38] [39] [40] . However, it remains unclear whether PfSWIB is involved in transcriptional regulation of virulence gene, especially vars, and its functional properties.To address the molecular mechanism of PfSWIB, we propose a new conditional knockdown system to study the function and mechanism of chromatin remodeler PfSWIB in regulating var gene expression. We found that the dysfunction of PfSWIB might lead to a significant downregulation of upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes at the ring stage in a PfSWIB-knockdown line, as well as the aberrant expression of certain var genes at the mature stage in a single 48-h life-cycle of P. falciparum, which was characterized by the reversion of transcriptional downregulation of upsA and partial upsB/ upsC var genes, suggesting that PfSWIB might play a key role on var gene regulating. In addition, PfSWIB knockdown could affect the growth and development of parasite. This study provides a better understanding of the regulatory function of chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) in regulating the clonal variation of var genes, and an essential insight into the regulation of the major virulence gene family contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites.Plasmodium falciparum lines 3D7, PfSWIB and PfSWIB∆ were first thawed and established for continuous cultivation in vitro according to standard procedures [41] . The cultivation was as follows: thawed isolates were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 25 mM Hepes, 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.1 mM hypoxanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China), 20 mg/ml gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China), 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2% human serum (type AB+; Changhai Hospital, The Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China). Cultures were grown in media with type O+ erythrocytes at a 3% hematocrit under 2% O 2 , 5.5% CO 2 , 92.5% N 2 at 37 °C. To obtain tightly synchronized ring stage parasites, a standard percoll/sorbitol synchronization method was performed [42, 43] . In brief, schizonts were isolated over a 40 and 60% percoll cushion and allowed to invade fresh RBCs for 0 to 6 h. The resulting rings were subjected to 5% sorbitol treatment for 5 min at 37 °C. This process was repeated twice. The culture was washed and re-suspended in complete medium containing 2% RBC after the final sorbitol treatment.All transfected parasite lines originated from the 3D7 clone. DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The high fidelity KOD-plus-Neo enzyme (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was used for PCR amplification to detect the endogenous PfSWIB locus or integration of the PfSWIB locus (PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID). PCR amplification reaction conditions are as follows: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 32 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 1 min, and a final extension cycle of 65 °C for 10 min. The specific primers used for PCR are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 .pLN-ENR-GFP [44] (GenBank: DQ813653.3) was modified by deleting the whole pfenr-gfp cassette, which was then used to clone various DNA fragments in ApaI/BamHI multicloning site. For the pLN-HA-FKBP-LID construct (6900 bp), the calmodulin promoter (5' CaM fragment) was initially substituted by a 1.5 kb C terminus of PfSWIB in the ApaI/ASCI multicloning site. Three duplicates of HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) and FKBP-LID tag were ligated towards the C terminus of PfSWIB via a linker sequence (AAAAVDAAAA). The resulting vector pLN-PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID was used to transfect the 3D7 clone. The HA tag consists of three tandem repeat sequences of influenza hemagglutinin, whereas the FKBP-LID tag is comprised of the FK506-and rapamycin-binding protein and a 19-amino-acid degron fused towards the C terminus of FKBP ( Fig. 1a ) [45] .Transfections were performed on synchronized ringstage parasites of 3D7 in a 2 mm BioRad Gene Pulser ® cuvettes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547, USA). A minimum of 100 μg recombinated plasmid DNA was initially purified and used for electroporation using the Bio-Rad GenePulse Xcell ™ electroporator (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA 94547, USA), at 310 V, with a resistance of 950 μF and a transfection time of less than 15 ms. Positive BSD drug selection at the final concentration of 2 nM, was subsequently applied and maintained after the first growth cycle. Those parasites that adopted the pLN-PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID construct carrying the bsd gene would offer a level of resistance to the drug. The transfected parasites were subjected to in vitro culturing for 25 to 40 days and subsequent BSD drug cycling to select stable single-crossover parasites. The initial obtained transfected parasite line was a mixture of the episomal and integrated form. Therefore, a '3 + 2' mode of drug screening process was subsequently introduced to enrich the integrated lines. In this process, the original transfected parasites were first cultured in vitro in the absence of BSD for 3 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of culture with BSD (2.5 µg/ml), therefore integrated lines of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID could possibly be further sorted after 2-3 rounds of drug cycling (Fig. 1b) . After two cycles of BSD 'off ' (3 weeks) and BSD 'on' (2 weeks), PCR was applied to detect the integration events of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID in transfected parasites lines by using specific primers (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Primers P2, P4 and P5 are specific to 3'UTR of endogenous PfSWIB, the upstream sequence of PfSWIB C-terminus and downstream plasmid sequence of HA-FKBP-LID fusion expression system, respectively, while Fn is the forward primer used for PCR amplification of PfSWIB C-terminus.In order to obtain purified integrated parasites clones, we utilized a clone screening assay by serial dilution of parasites in 96-well plates, as detailed previously [46] . Two stable transfections of PfSWIB-FKBP-LID integrated parasites clones, PfSWIB-C2 and PfSWIB-B10 were obtained. The integration events were detected on screened clones after extended the culture to 24-well plates. The primers used for testing the clones are described above (see also Additional file 1: Table S1 ). PCR amplification reaction conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 32 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 2 min, and a final extension cycle of 65 °C for 10 min.To analyze the expression of the PfSWIB fusion system in integrated parasites lines, total parasite extracts were prepared by treatment with 0.15% saponin and re-suspended in SDS-loading buffer (Bio-Rad), then separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and subjected to western blot analysis. Total proteins from the 3D7 clone were used as controls. An antibody to aldolase (1:1000 dilution; Roche, Indianapolis, USA) was used as a positive control. Rabbit anti-HA (1:1000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used to identify PfSWIB fusion proteins in different parasite lines. An enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) western blotting kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to develop western blots. The theoretical molecular weight of endogenous PfSWIB, HA tag and HA-FKBP-LID tag is 92kD, 3.5kD and 22kD, respectively. The graylevel image analysis procedure was implemented with ImageJ software. Statistical significance was determined (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).Synchronized ring parasites (0-6 h after re-invasion) of the PfSWIB integrated clone (PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID) and the 3D7 clone were collected and diluted to 0.2% parasitemia. Each diluted parasite clone was divided into two wells of parasite cultures in the 24-well plate (50 µl RBC pellets/1 ml medium). Shield1 (0.5 mM (diluted in ethanol); Clontech, Mountain View, USA) was added into one of the two wells (final concentration: 0.5 μM). Consequently, four parasite lines including PfSWIB, PfSWIBΔ, 3D7 (shield1 induced) and 3D7 sh− (shield1 not induced) were subject to in vitro culture for 4-5 days. The parasitemia of each parasite line was counted every 12 h up to 96 h and repeated twice. The rate of parasitemia (%) of different lines were compared statistically by a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01). Growth curve analysis was performed in triplicate.For the transcription level assay of individual var genes, we used the var primer pairs published elsewhere [47] and listed in Additional file 2: Table S2 . qPCR assays were performed as described previously [10] . In brief, total RNA of synchronous parasite culture was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [48] . cDNA was prepared in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations (Thermofisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The fold change between the experimental and reference groups was calculated as 2 −ΔΔCq . qPCR was performed on a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Singapore) using a program of 1 cycle of 15 s at 95 °C and 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, 30 s at 60 °C. Seryl-tRNA synthetase was applied as an endogenous control gene and to normalize the transcriptional level of each var gene. For the qPCR data, statistical significance was determined with the two-tailed Student's t-test (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01).RNA-seq was used to screen differentially expressed genes in three parasite lines and was carried out in duplicate. The reference genome and transcript information (P. falciparum 3D7) were obtained from PlasmoDB (http://plasm odb.org/). The RNA-seq aligner STAR v2.5.3a [49] was used to create a genome catalog, based on two data files including a genome sequence fasta file and GFF3 annotation file (PlasmoDB-34_Pfalcipa-rum3D7_Genome.fasta, PlasmoDB-34_Pfalciparum3D7. gff ). FastQC v0.11.5 was subsequently used to analyze the quality of the RNA-seq reads. The qualified reads were subsequently mapped and aligned to the reference genome. Reads with a minimum mapping quality of 20 (− q 20) were further screened out by using SAM tools. Heatmaps of gene expression profiles in different lines were created by using the R package edgeR [50] . Hierarchical clustering was performed by using one minus Pearson's correlation metric and average linkage method. Line plots were generated with ggplot2 [51] . In order to carry out an analysis of variance (ANOVA)-like differential gene expression analysis, a statistical analysis of summarized read counts per genomic feature obtained from feature Counts function [52] was performed by using the R package ALDEx2 [53, 54] . A fold change greater than 1.5 or lower than − 1.5, FDR < 0.05, and P < 0.05 were selected as filters for defining the sets of differentially expressed genes. [44] , which harbored an antibiotic selection marker (bsd for Blasticidin S resistance, pink). HA tags (red) and FKBP-LID tag (blue and green) were ligated towards the 1.5 kb C terminus of PfSWIB. b Drug screening of the PfSWIB fusion expression system. The integration events and expression of PfSWIB modified locus were identified by PCR. 'BSD+' and 'BSD-' indicate that the transfected parasites were cultured in the presence or absence of BSD. Day 24: in vitro culturing in the absence of BSD for 24 days. Day 5, 10 and 15: in vitro culturing in the presence of BSD for 5, 10 and 15 days, respectively. The details of specific primers used for detecting the endogenous, episomal and integrated PfSWIB locus are provided in 'Methods'Due to the low transfection proficiency after inserting the full-length PfSWIB gene, we subsequently selected a 1.5 kb C terminal sequence of PfSWIB and cloned this into the modified recombinant plasmids pLN-ENR-GFP forming fusion gene expression system pLN-PfSWIB (C-terminus)-HA-FKBP-LID. Through homologous recombination caused by a single crossover event, a transfected parasite clone known as PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID was obtained by transfecting the recombinant plasmid pLN-PfSWIB (C-terminus)-HA-FKBP-LID into the 3D7 strain, which was selected by Blasticidin S deaminase (BSD). The HA tag contains three tandem repeat sequences of influenza hemagglutinin, whereas FKBP-LID tag is comprised of the FK506and rapamycin-binding protein and a 19-amino-acid degron (ligand-induced degradation domain) fused to the C terminus of FKBP (Fig. 1a) [45] . A drug cycling process was subsequently introduced to enrich the integrated lines. The integration events and expression of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID fusion gene were first identified by PCR (Fig. 1b) . The specific primers designed for detecting the transfection proficiency of the PfSWIB modified locus are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1 . Additional file 3: Figure S1 shows the screening of integrated clones which were performed by serial dilution and identification of integration events by PCR. Stable transfections of PfSWIB-FKBP-LID integrated parasites clones PfSWIB-C2 and PfSWIB-B10 were finally obtained from the cloning and screening process in 96-well plates. Since the PfSWIB-C2 clone exhibited stability and reproducibility in the subsequent assays, such as PCR detection and qPCR analysis, we selected clone PfSWIB-C2 rather than clone PfSWIB-B10 for the present study.Western blotting was subsequently performed to detect the expression of PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID fusion protein in the presence and absence of shield1 (1:2000, 0.5 μM). According to the previous study, PfSWIB is theoretically stable in the absence of the small molecule shield1 [45] . Alternatively, shield1 binds tightly to FKBP thereby substituting the degron and triggering rapid, continuous degradation of the LID domain and PfSWIB [45] . As shield1 may take time to exert its inhibition function, we selected the in vitro culturing ring and trophozoite parasite stage within their third life-cycle (> 96 h) as testing samples, according to the GCA results (Fig. 2a) . The results indicated that although the PfSWIB-HA-FKBP-LID (114 kDa) fusion gene could be successfully expressed in both stages in the presence or absence of shield1 (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2a) , there was still a significant difference of PfSWIB fusion protein expression between PfSWIB∆ and PfSWIB lines in the trophozoite stage, the expression of PfSWIB fusion protein decreased in PfSWIB∆ line (t (2) = 4.890, P = 0.0394). In contrast, no significant difference had been found in the ring stage parasite (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b, Additional file 4: Figure S2b) .To study the specific functions of PfSWIB, we subsequently analyzed the growth curve by counting parasitemia of different groups within 96 h (Fig. 2 , Additional file 5: Table S3 ). Both PfSWIB-C2 and 3D7 parasite clones were initially synchronized into 0-6 h ring stage parasites and equally divided into two groups. One group contained shield1 in the culture medium, whereas the other group was lacking shield1. Thus, four groups of lines including PfSWIB∆ (PfSWIB shield1 induced), PfSWIB (PfSWIB sh− shield1 not induced), 3D7 sh+ and 3D7 sh− were subject into the in vitro culture, with exactly the same preliminary parasitemia of 0.2%.The results of GCA revealed no significant difference in parasitemia between these lines during the first 48 h life-cycle (F (3, 6) Based on the GCA result, we subsequently performed RNA-seq analysis in duplicate with synchronized 0-6 h ring stage parasites of three P. falciparum lines within their third life-cycle, to study the change of expression profiling when knocking down PfSWIB. The scatter plot illustrates the comparison of screening of differentially expressed genes in three parasite lines, including 3D7, PfSWIB and PfSWIB∆ (Additional file 6: Figure S3a ). Among all differentially expressed genes, 112 and 450 were upregulated in the PfSWIB∆ line when compared with the PfSWIB and 3D7 line, respectively, whereas 1 and 616 genes were downregulated (fold change, FC > 1.5, P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05). We further performed hierarchical clustering of the individual gene expression profiles by using the R package edgeR. RNA-seq data were normalized for sequencing depth and gene length using log 2 -transformed FPKM values (Additional file 6: Figure  S3b ). According to the special characteristics of differentially expressed proteins in each line, we further screened out transcription factors such as PfApiAP2 family and PfSir2B, as well as certain histone modification enzymes, which proved to be involved in regulating on var gene transcription. These genes were significantly upregulated in the PfSWIB∆ line, suggesting the existence of their different transcription profiling when knocking down PfSWIB. In addition, a number of vars also exhibited differential expression among different lines (Additional file 2: Table S2 ).To further study the transcription patterns of upsA-, upsB-and upsC-subtype var genes in different parasite lines, we first selected 44 differentially expressed vars among different lines based on the RNA-seq results (fold change, FC > 1.5, P < 0.05, FDR < 0.05), and tested the expression patterns of these preferred vars in each comparison group at the ring stage (0-10 h after re-invasion in 3rd life-cycle, > 96 h) by real-time PCR (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). upsB or upsA corresponds to subtelomeric and upsC corresponds to chromosome internal var gene members [55, 56] . Figure 3 shows the fold change of var gene expression profiling between shield1 pre-and post-induced lines PfSWIB∆ vs PfSWIB. Most upsA-and upsC-type vars were significantly downregulated in the PfSWIB∆ line, especially the upsA vars, when compared to the PfSWIB line (Fig. 3 , Additional file 7: Figure S4 ). However, the expression pattern of partial upsB vars presented a distinct change in the PfSWIB∆ line. A group of 9 upsB vars exhibited a high level of expression (Fig. 3 , red asterisk) (fold change ≥ 2.0, P < 0.05), while 5 upsB vars present an extremely low expression level (Fig. 3 , black asterisk) (fold change ≤ − 2.0, P < 0.05), when compared the PfSWIB∆ line to other lines.We subsequently re-analyzed the RNA-seq results of vars in these lines by using the R package edgeR, to identify similarities and differences in expression patterns for different var variants. The heatmap representing the hierarchical clustering of the var genes is shown in Fig. 4 and Additional file 8: Figure S5 . Figure 4 indicates two major clusters of 44 selected vars in relation to the expression pattern: one major cluster consisting of 37 var variants covered most of upsA, upsB and all upsC vars, while the other cluster covered only 5 upsB and 2 upsA vars. In addition, there were 24 and 20 vars variants showed an expression maximum in the 3D7 line and PfSWIB∆ line, respectively (red box). Additional linear regression analysis of the correlation between qPCR and RNA-seq data was performed to investigate the transcriptome data accuracy on 44 var genes (Additional file 9: Figure S6 , Additional file 10: Table S4 ). In the PfSWIB vs PfSWIB∆ comparison, the qPCR data showed a significant linear correlation with the RNA-seq data (r (44) = 0.6281, P < 0.0001). The RNA-seq results of 9 upregulated and 5 downregulated upsB vars (described above by qPCR analysis in the PfSWIB∆ line), were also re-analyzed by computing the log 2 fold change of FPKM values in different lines. Of these, 5 out of 9 upregulated upsB vars (except for PF3D7_1300100, PF3D7_1200100, PF3D7_0900100 and PF3D7_0712300) (Fig. 4, red arrow) , and 4 out of 5 downregulated (except for PF3D7_1240300) (Fig. 4 , black arrow) showed consistency with the qPCR results. Additional file 8: Figure S5 shows the expression pattern and hierarchical clustering of all the 60 vars in the three lines.According to previous studies, var genes were highly expressed in the ring stage, while drastically downregulated in the trophozoite stage [6, 10, 11] . To confirm this, we initially collected RNA samples from the ring and trophozoite stages of the 3D7 clone within the third . Approximately all of the var genes, were downregulated at the mature stage of 3D7 sh+ and 3D7 sh− parasite lines, except for PF3D7-0632500 (upsA), and PF3D7_1219300 and PF3D7_0712900 (upsB), suggesting that shield1 may have no influence on the expression of most var genes in a single 48 hour-life cycle of P. falciparum (Additional file 11: Figure S7) .We subsequently analyzed the log 2 ratio of T/R in invitro cultured PfSWIB∆ and PfSWIB lines within their third life-cycle after collecting RNA samples from their synchronized ring and trophozoite parasites. Among these parasite lines, PfSWIB exhibited a quite similar log 2 ratio of T/R to 3D7, which was characterized by the downregulation of most var genes at the mature stage (Fig. 5) . In contrast, approximately all of the upsA vars, as well as partial upsB (PF3D7_1200400, PF3D7_0632500, PF3D7_1219300, PF3D7_1240300 and PF3D7_1240400) and upsC (PF3D7_0412900, PF3D7_0420900 and PF3D7_0617400) vars were activated at the mature stage of P. falciparum in the PfSWIB∆ line (Fig. 5 ).The interplay between altered histone modification, chromatin modifying machinery, and general or sequence-specific transcription factors results in var gene regulation by modulating chromatin structure [57] . In this process, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) play a key role in chromatin remodeling through removal and movements of nucleosomes and deposition of alternative histones [13] . There are at least 11 proteins containing putative SWI2/SNF2 ATPase catalytic domains in P. falciparum [58] , seven of which are predicted to be chromatin-modifying proteins, including ISWI, Swr1, CHD1, SNF2L, MAL8P1.65, PFB0730w, PFF0225w and PF13_0308 [18] . However, it remains unclear how these PfCRCs regulate var gene expression by remodeling certain chromatin and therefore resulting in a high level of antigenic variation, immunity evasion and pathopoiesis.The SWI/SNF complex, originally revealed in yeasts, allows for transcriptional activation by remodeling chromatin [59] . It has also been demonstrated previously that mammalian SWI/SNF homologs complexes, also known as BRG1-associated factors (BAFs), can be found in multiple forms which consist of 9-12 proteins. Among these BAFs, BAF60b exists in an alternative form of the SWI/ SNF complex (Complex B), which is generally known as SWI-B or SWIB [34] . In humans, the BAF60a protein of the SWI/SNF complex is responsible for p53 binding and regulates its activities via an N-terminal region of the SWIB/MDM2 domain [35] , as well as facilitating cell cycle halting and tune the balance between repair and apoptosis induction [35] [36] [37] . SWIB/MDM2 domains have in fact been shown to participate in protein-protein [60] and chromatin-related interactions [61] , but their functional roles in other species are poorly understood. Similarly, the SWI/SNF complex is composed of constant units and includes the Swp73p/SNF12 protein comprising a SWIB/MDM2 domain, proposed to facilitate specificity and/or functionality to some extent [38, 62] . According to recent studies, the P. falciparum genome encodes two putative SWIB/MDM2 domain-containing proteins: PfMDM2 (PF3D70518200, SWIB/MDM2 domaincontaining protein) and PfSWIB (PF3D70611400, SWI/ SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin) [38] , and PfSWIB was not only crucial for the survival and growth of the parasite, but additionally had profound effects on the parasite by interacting with other unknown proteins [38] [39] [40] . Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that PfSWIB is characterized by its SWIB domain (BAF60b domain, PlasmoDB, http://plasm odb. org/). Bonger et al. [45] have recently developed a new technique by which the degradation of a specific protein is definitely induced by way of a small molecule, shield1. Hence, an in-depth functional analysis of PfSWIB based on the conditional knock-down assay was implemented in the present study. By using a transgenic assay, drug screening and subsequent screening of the clones, we obtained two integrated parasite clones PfSWIB-C2 and B10, with a stable transfection of the modified locus PfSWIB-FKBP-LID into the Plasmodium parasites (Fig. 1 , Additional file 3: Figure S1 ). Western blot analysis confirmed that the fusion expression protein was successfully expressed in the transfected parasite lines, and there was a significant decrease of PfSWIB fusion protein expression in the PfSWIB∆ line (t (2) = 4.890, P = 0.0394), at its trophozoite stage within third life-cycle of P. falciparum. However, it should be noted that no significant change was detected in the protein expression level of PfSWIB fusion system during the ring stage, either in the presence or absence of drug pressure (t (2) = 1.006, P = 0.4205) (Fig. 2b , Additional file 4: Figure S2 ). This could be due to at least two reasons. First, it takes time for shield1 to work at full capacity through binding to LID, therefore, a portion or slight loss of fused PfSWIB protein could not be identified. Secondly, this protein might be expressed predominantly at the mature stage of P. falciparum.It is worth noting that PfSWIB may lead to stage-specific PCD, in the same way as BAF60a of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex induces p53-directed apoptosis, by which transient nuclear localization results in removal of these parasites, as previously described [35] . Vieira et al. [38] further demonstrated that PfSWIB could have a stage-specific, pro-survival function and takes part in the heat stress response of the Plasmodium parasite. They discovered that PfSWIB and PfARK3 participate in preventing p53-mediated apoptosis within the nucleus in reaction to heat stress [38] . Alternatively, human Aurora kinase B and its yeast homologue play key roles during gene transcription through histone H3 phosphorylation [39, 40] . Likewise, PfSWIB could also have an effect on parasite survival through transcriptional regulation by guiding the PfARK3's phosphorylation activities [39, 40] . In our study, growth curve analysis of P. falciparum revealed that a relatively low parasitemia was observed in the PfSWIB knockdown line (PfSWIB∆) when compared to other parasite lines during their second life-cycle. Significant change was observed after 96 hours, when the parasites developed into the third life-cycle. The parasitemia of PfSWIB∆ showed a sharp decline (Fig. 2a) , suggesting that PfSWIB might play a key role in the proliferation and survival of P. falciparum.On the other hand, Jiang et al. [27] proved that knocking out the P. falciparum variant-silencing SET gene, which encodes an ortholog of Drosophila melanogaster ASH1 and controls histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) on var genes, leads to expression of all vars. In another study focused on a novel chromatin-associated exoribonuclease, termed PfRNase II, Zhang et al. [63] revealed that this PfRNase II controls the silencing of upsA var genes, by marking their transcription start site and intron promoter regions leading to short-lived cryptic RNA. Depletion of PfRNase II specifically removes the silencing of upsA vars. Similarly, in the present study, knocking down of PfSWIB results in the silencing of upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes, as well as removes the silencing of partial upsB vars (Fig. 3 , Additional file 7: Figure S4 ). Therefore, PfSWIB might be one of the trans factors activating var genes, especially the upsA vars, and silencing partial upsB vars. In addition, a few var genes exhibited inconsistent RNA-seq results with qPCR, especially the upsA vars. They are more likely to be conditionally activated in the PfSWIB knockdown line, according to the RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 4 , Additional file 8: Figure  S5 ). The minor inconsistency between the RNA-seq and the qPCR results for partial vars could be due to false positives/negatives resulting from either of these two methods, or experimental variation caused by different parasite lines or other unidentified factors. Nevertheless, by comparing the log 2 fold change data from qPCR and RNA-seq on 44 var genes, we confirmed that the linear regression and linear correlation analysis showed a significant linear correlation between the two methods (r (44) =v0.6281, P < 0.0001) (Additional file 9: Figure S6) .Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that var genes were highly expressed in the ring stage of P. falciparum, while drastically downregulated in the trophozoite stage. The var transcriptional levels in trophozoites are usually 10-100 times less than those in rings [6, 7, 10, 11] . A single P. falciparum parasite simultaneously transcribes multiple var genes but selects only one PfEMP-1 to attain the surface of the host cell by way of a developmentally regulated process [6, 7] . In order to test whether the transcription pattern had been disrupted when knocking down PfSWIB, we subsequently compared the transcription level of selected var genes between ring and trophozoite stage parasites, by testing the log 2 fold change of T/R in each group during a single life-cycle of P. falciparum (Fig. 5 , Additional file 11: Figure S7 ). Strikingly, we discovered that most of the upsA, upsB and upsC vars were downregulated in PfSWIB and 3D7 lines, while virtually all the upsA vars and partial upsB/upsC vars were significantly upregulated at the trophozoite-stage of the PfSWIB∆ line within the third life-cycle of P. falciparum (Fig. 5) , suggesting that PfSWIB might be involved in temporal regulation of var genes, particularly group A vars. The dysfunction of PfSWIB could disrupt the interactions between PfSWIB and other transcription factors which are essential for gene silencing or inhibit PfSWIB activity through unknown mechanisms.As we mentioned previously, P. falciparum varies its surface protein expression, particularly the var gene family-encoded clonally variant surface protein expression, to evade host immune responses [6] . In the process of monoallelic expression, specific silent var genes are usually retained at unique perinuclear sites and relocated to transcriptionally active zones [21, 28] . Nuclear actin has been discovered complexed with PfSET10, which has been suggested to play a role in the movement of the locus during activation and heterochromatic silencing [26, 29] . Actin and actin-related proteins (Arps) are common components of chromatin remodeling complexes and are involved in nuclear positioning. According to biological characteristics, PfSWIB may be involved in the process of relocating episomes, as an actin-dependent regulator of chromatin. Further studies regarding the possible role of PfSWIB and actin interaction would be worthwhile.In the present study, we revealed that actin-related chromatin remodeling factor PfSWIB is involved in the process of clonal variation in var gene expression, and is crucial for the survival and growth of the Plasmodium parasite. Depletion of PfSWIB not only silences upsA, upsC and partial upsB var genes and removes the silencing of partial upsB var genes, but also leads to the aberrant expression of upsA and partial upsB/upsC var genes at the mature stage of P. falciparum, during a single 48-hour life-cycle. These findings could provide a better understanding of the regulatory function of PfCRCs in regulating the clonal variation of the var gene family contributing to the pathogenesis in malaria parasites."}, {"qas" : [{"question":"What is the structure of the virus?", "id": "0a0cbd4cb08c862deadcb5aaef22a27b770c0791", "is_impossible": false}], "context" : "Respiratory viruses are common causes of human disease. Molecular detection techniques have allowed previously known viruses to be more reliably identified and new viruses to be discovered [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Molecular techniques such as real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR) can be performed for each individual virus, or they can be combined into a multiplex RT-rtPCR assay. Other molecular methods that can target a single analyte or multiple viruses use a variety of nucleic acid detection based strategies, including microarrays [11] , mass spectrometry [12] , spectrally distinct bead microarrays [13] , capillary electrophoresis [14] , or microsphere flow cytometry [15] .The performance of molecular diagnostic methods, either RT-rtPCR or multiplex assays, typically has been evaluated by comparing them with conventional direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or culture, with few direct comparisons reported between molecular assays. Moreover, there are few reports of laboratories collaboratively comparing methods between institutions. In this study, we compared a multiplex respiratory virus panel (Respiratory MultiCode Assay [RMA], EraGen Biosciences and U. Wisconsin-Madison) with RT-rtPCR (Vanderbilt University) for the detection of 11 common respiratory viruses.Nasal and throat swabs were collected from children ≤ 12 months old who were admitted to the Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at Vanderbilt from September 1, 2005 through May 31, 2006 with acute respiratory illness, as part of the Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative [16] . All specimens collected during this period were included in the study. Within four hours of collection, the samples were divided into aliquots, lysis buffer added, and specimens were frozen at -80°C. Separate unthawed aliquots were sent to the research laboratories at Vanderbilt University and University of Wisconsin-Madison for RT-rtPCR and RMA testing, respectively.Single RT-rtPCR experiments were performed for the following 11 viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 (PIV1, PIV2, PIV3), and human coronaviruses Netherlands (NL-63), OC43, and 229E. RNA was extracted on an automated instrument (MagNApure Total Nucleic Acid extraction kit; Roche Applied Science), and refrozen at -80°C until each individual RT-rtPCR was performed. Primers and probes for HCoV-NL63, OC43, 229E, RSV, HMPV and HRV were obtained from the published literature [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Influenza primer and probe sequences were provided by Steve Lindstrom, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [23] . Primers and probes for PIV1, 2 and 3 were designed using Primer Express version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). Primer and probe sequences, concentration, and annealing temperatures are listed in Table 1 . Twenty-five-μL reaction mixtures containing 5 μL of specimen RNA were tested using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) on a Smart Cycler II (Cepheid). Cycling conditions were 30 min at 50°C, 15 min at 94°C, and 45 cycles of 8 seconds at 94°C and 60 seconds at 55-66°C (Table 1 ). All RT-rtPCR assays were optimized and characterized using RNA runoff transcripts and were capable of detecting < 50 RNA transcript copies/reaction (data not shown). All samples were tested by a commercial RT-rtPCR assay for human beta-actin mRNA (Applied Biosystems) to ensure RNA integrity.RMA is a multitarget, high throughput technology that integrates multiplex PCR and microsphere flow cytometry [15, 24, 25] . While the Luminex technology can detect up to 80 targets in one reaction, this version of the assay included 19 viral targets. We report results for the same 11 viruses tested by the RT-rtPCR assays. Nucleic acid was extracted with Trizol reagents. The RMA assay was performed with primers and conditions as previously described, including the addition of an external insect virus spiked into each specimen to control for RNA extraction, RT, and PCR [15] .Both sites were blinded to the results from the other laboratory until all data were analyzed. In order to address potential weaknesses indicated by discordant results between the two assays in the first round of comparison, both RT-rtPCR and RMA testing were modified for a second round of testing. The first round primers and probes for RSV and HMPV [19, 21] were changed for the RT-rtPCR assay [18] and (Klemenc et al, unpublished data) and all samples were retested for these two viruses. In the RMA assay, the primers and probe for influenza A were modified and the cDNA synthesis protocol was changed from Promega reagents to the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Kit.Demographic and clinical variables of the study sample are described as frequencies and percent or median and interquartile ranges [IQR] as appropriate. The RMA and RT-rtPCR assays were compared using the test for inter-rater agreement (kappa coefficient). Kappa coefficient was calculated for any comparison in which the value of all data cells was ≥ 3, with a kappa ≥ 0.75 considered to indicate good agreement. Bootstrapping was used to estimate 95% confidence limits of kappa. Cycle threshold (Ct) numbers for influenza and RSV were compared between groups of specimens using the t-test.A total of 225 infants hospitalized with respiratory symptoms were enrolled from September 2005 through May 2006. Samples from 222 children were available for study in both sites; three specimens were only available for RMA testing. Study children were 57% male with a median age of 13 weeks [IQR 7-33 weeks]. The admitting diagnoses of these infants were bronchiolitis (58%), upper respiratory infection (33%), and other (9%).Rates of viral detection were compared using both assay methods. Restricting the analysis to the 11 viruses tested with both methods, at least one virus was detected in 174 (78.3%) samples by RMA and in 163 (73.4%) samples by RT-rtPCR. A total of 194 and 196 viruses were identified in these samples by RMA and RT-rtPCR, respectively (Table 2) .In the first round of testing, RMA detected more RSV (n = 98, 44%) than RT-rtPCR (n = 78, 35%). The kappa coefficient between the two tests was 0.66. RMA also differentiated between RSV sub-types A and B. Of the RSV positive samples detected by RMA, 67 were RSV A and 32 were RSV B (one sample had both RSV A and RSV B). Of the 67 RSV A identified through RMA, RT-rtPCR detected RSV in 65 (97%) of them. However, of the 42 RSV B detected by RMA, RT-rtPCR only detected RSV B in 6 (14.2%) samples.In the second round, the primers and probes for the RSV RT-rtPCR assay were redesigned based on further analysis of published viral sequences [18] . Using these new primers and probes, RSV was identified in 107 (49%) samples with RT-rtPCR. The inter rater agreement for RSV between the repeat RT-rtPCR and the first RMA was 0.86. Of the 67 RSV A and 32 RSV B detected by the RMA assay, the repeat sample analysis detected RSV in 66 and 28 respectively. 12 samples were positive for RSV with repeat RT-rtPCR testing but negative for RSV with RMA testing; the mean Ct for these specimens was higher than the mean Ct for specimens detected by both assays (34.54 ± 3.18 vs. 28.58 ± 3.71, p < 0.001).In the first round, the RT-rtPCR detected influenza A in 25 (11.2%) samples while the RMA detected influenza A in 7 (3.1%) samples. RT-rtPCR detected influenza B in 1 sample while RMA detected influenza B in a different sample. In the second round of testing, the influenza A RMA primers and probes were redesigned. Compared to 25 samples positive for influenza A by rRT-PCR, the repeat RMA assay detected 5 positive samples; all 5 were also detected by the RT-rtPCR assay. The mean Ct of the 5 influenza A specimens detected by the RMA assay was lower than the mean Ct of all influenza A specimens (30.02 ± 1.98 vs. 34.99 ± 1.88, p < 0.001).RT-rtPCR detected HRV in 63 (28.2%) samples as compared to the RMA, which detected HRV in 56 (25.1%) samples (kappa coefficient 0.78). In two of the discordant samples, RT-rtPCR detected HRV while the RMA detected enterovirus.During the first round of testing, RMA detected HMPV in 8 (3.5%) samples while RT-rtPCR detected HMPV in 2 (0.9%) samples. In the second round using redesigned RT-rtPCR HMPV primers and probes, HMPV was detected in 7 samples, 5 of which were concordant with the results of the first RMA assay. The first RMA assay detected HMPV in 2 additional samples that were not detected by the repeat RT-rtPCR assay, while one sample positive for HMPV in the first RMA was negative in the second set of tests.NL63 was detected in 8 (3.5%) samples through RMA and in 6 (2.7%) samples through RT-rtPCR. HCoV OC43 was detected in 5 (2.2%) samples through RMA and in 5 (2.3%) samples through RT-rtPCR. HCoV 229E was not detected in any sample by either assay.PIV1 was detected in 10 (4.4%) samples through RMA and in 13 (5.8%) samples through RT-rtPCR. PIV 2 was detected in 1 (0.5%) sample through RMA and in 1 (0.5%) sample through RT-rtPCR. No PIV3 was detected by either method. The comparison of the first and second run of RMA assay is summarized in Table 2 . The most notable discrepancies between runs were for HRV and RSV.The sensitivity and specificity of multiplex viral diagnostic assays have generally been compared to viral culture and DFA [1] , instead of more sensitive RT-rtPCR methods [2, [26] [27] [28] . Comparison of molecular methods with other sensitive molecular techniques, such as RMA with RT-rtPCR, is appropriate to determine whether the sensitivity for each analyte is sufficient for clinical or research use. Although both assays performed well for selected viruses in this study, the first round of comparison revealed differences in the rates of detection for specific viruses ( Table  2 ). The RMA assay detected significantly more HMPV and RSV, while the RT-rtPCR assay detected more influenza A and HRV. Redesigning primers led to substantial improvements in the detection of HMPV and RSV by rRT-PCR, while there was little improvement in the performance of RMA for influenza virus with the change in primers. This discordance could have been due to sequence variation; there was insufficient residual specimen to sequence the viruses. However, both influenza A assays targeted regions of the matrix gene that are highly conserved among GenBank sequences (data not shown). The mean Ct of the influenza and RSV specimens detected only by the RT-rtPCR assay was significantly higher than those detected by the RMA assay, suggesting that the discordance may have been due to the sensitivity of the two assays for specimens with a lower viral load. One recent study compared a commercial version of the RMA known as PLx-Respiratory Viral Assay (PLx-RVP) to RT-rtPCR and found good concordance, but only tested a portion of the PLx-RVP negative samples [29] . The RMA and PLx-RVP differ both in primer sequences, and in the method used to extract RNA and perform reverse transcription. Both of these factors are important determinants of assay sensitivity. Given that RNA viruses are prone to mutation [30] , currently circulating field strains of these viruses should be regularly monitored for sequence divergences that would affect primers and probes used in PCR-based assays. This is particularly true for influenza, which undergoes considerable variation every year. Molecular assays are often targeted to conserved internal genes, but this is based on known sequences. Further, due to segment reassortment and antigenic shift, new internal gene segments may arise among influenza viruses infecting humans. For multiplex assays such as the RMA, inclusion of two probe sets that target two different parts of the viral genome might eliminate the risk that a single mutation would lead to nondetection.Our study has some limitations. First, we did not use identical extraction methods and primers in the RT-rtPCR and RMA assays, and therefore discrepant results could have been due to differences in these processes or primer design. However, this was an intentional choice, since the specific goal of this study was to compare two 'real-world' methods. Both laboratories have published extensively in the area of respiratory virus diagnostics and epidemiology, and have evaluated their independent methods. This study shows that collaboration between groups offers a valuable tool to assess assay performance impartially. Second, we did not use a gold standard test to confirm presence or absence of virus in cases of discrepancy between the two assays. We explored the option of sequencing of the discordant samples to detect sequence differences or false positives, but there was not enough residual specimen to allow this. Nonetheless, we repeated the testing of viruses that had major discrepancies with the assumption that if the repeats were positive, it provided reassurance that the positive samples were true positives. Third, the RT-rtPCR was only repeated for HMPV and RSV due to limited sample; there could have been discordances for other viruses. Fourth, the RMA assay was repeated with altered influenza primers while other primers were unchanged; it is possible that a change in influenza primers had an impact on the overall performance of the assay. One important consideration for any multiplex assay is the need to re-optimize for all targets when a change is made in any of the primers used. Finally, the results were not evaluated by DFA or culture, though the objective was to directly compare sequence-based methods.In summary, for most viruses tested, there was good agreement between the two assays. However, discrepancies highlight the need for similar comparisons between molecular assays on a routine basis, so that weaknesses can be promptly identified and corrected. While investigators may be reluctant to make comparisons that might suggest deficiencies of particular methods, collaborative studies such as ours are critical to advance these diagnostic methodologies. Two other recent studies comparing molecular methods identified similar discrepancies [29, 31] . In addition to clinical specimens validated by culture, respiratory virus proficiency panels distributed by quality control programs like the European Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics (QCMD) [32] , CDC, or College of American Pathologists, or commercial proficiency panels (e.g., ZeptoMetrix NATtrol™ Respiratory Validation Panels) provide an external quality control. Clearly, the overall comparison between molecular methods should consider the performance of each individual analyte. The goal of this study was not to determine which is the 'best' assay; the choice of assay for a given purpose depends on many factors, including cost, available equipment and expertise, sample volume, and others. Multiplex assays may offer substantial savings in time and cost due to multiple analytes, and are generally preferred for clinical testing. Comparison of molecular diagnostic methods to culture and DFA is useful to establish validity, and ensure that cultivable viruses are correctly identified by sequence-based technology. However, our data show that molecular diagnostic methods also must be compared to other molecular techniques to assess performance, particularly because of the superior sensitivity of the molecular methods compared to culture and DFA."}, {"qas" : [{"question":"What is the structure of the virus?", "id": "0a0afb5dc02afa81689e0e75afe2f9a21ce09e70", "is_impossible": false}], "context" : "4. The role of ubiquitination and the proteins that regulate it are the focus of Figure 3 . In Figure 3 the control used in figure 3I is 3-MA treatment. First, how much 3-MA was used? Specificity of its inhibition diminishes at higher concentrations above 10uM. The data presented show that 3-MA is not working in this assay, as there is no decrease in long-term protein degradation observed unlike siSKP2 which shows an increase in long-term protein levels when knocked down. Why should 3-MA not show an increase in this experiment? This is the same result in Figure 4D where 3-MA has no effect on protein levels. This is not discussed in the text. Figure 4 , there are several controls missing in the figure. First, there are no toxicity controls showing that the range of each inhibitor used is below significant cell toxicity levels. Secondly, the control in 4D using HBSS as an inducer of autophagy is not shown. Please show experimental evidence that in this experiment HBSS induces autophagy. Third, in 4E, BECN1 levels increase with all drugs; however LC3B increases with only 2 of them, and there doesn't seem to be a change in P62. There should be some correlation between these results but there is no consistency.6. As MERS-CoV infection and proteins are considered for their role in autophagy, there are several conflicting results. First, the figure numbering does not match the text. Secondly, in Figure 5E , for the WCE blot it is not clear how you can observe both SNAP29 and STX17 in the same blot where it does not show up in the IP blots. Shouldn't they be in the same complex since they are crosslinked so they show as 1 band? The order of 5F and G should be reversed. And 5F is not clear. I assume it is a quantitation of 5G, however it does not match the data in 5G. The relationship between ATG14 monomeric and oligomeric forms and autophagy is not made clear. Are there published data showing oliogomeric ATG14 actively inhibits autophagosome to lysosome fusion, or simply that it fails to promote fusion? Also, if MERS is inhibiting oligomerization, I would expect there to be an increase in monomer, which is not seen. Does total ATG14 amount change? Please clarify. figure S3 is also confusing. First, the cropped cells in S3E do not line up, please clean up the cropping. Secondly, there does not seem to be an increase yellow staining and a correlated decrease in red staining in the single cell shown in each panel. This example cell does not correlate with F. Third, the mutant viruses with either 4b or 5 deleted are great, however does the 4b deletion virus still contain the entire 4a coding region or was is 4a ORF effected when 4b was deleted? The oligos are in the methods section but no explanation in the text to the sites of the deletion. There are also no growth curves showing the 2 deletion viruses compared to WT virus. Do they grow equally well in the experiments or are they attenuated in their growth under control conditions? Fourth, the virus output that is examined in K is only looking at mRNA with no statistically significant different noted however it is stated in the text that the SKP2i inhibitor effects MERS growth. The K panel seems to be missing data. And the correlation should be with virus titer not mRNA since the autophagy effect would be expected to be on virus egress not transcription?8. In the model figure and in the discussion, there is no description of data presented to show the direct effect of SKP2 on ATG14 oligomerization. Since this is a key feature of the model, it would be important to show that SKP2 siRNA or inhibition by drugs effects the ATG14 oligo/monomer relationship.Minor Issues 1. Figure 1B . The whole cell lysates shown in the 2nd and 3rd lane for BECN1 (3rd blot down) are different however they are the same in the IP blot for BECN1 (2nd blot down). Please correct or explain why there are differences.Reviewer #2: Remarks to the Author: Gassen et al reported here a very complete study of a novel regulation of autophagy by SKP2, a E3 ubiquitin ligase. They nicely demonstrated that SKP2 targets BECN1, an autophagy protein which is involved in autophagosome formation and maturation in two different complexes. SKP2 executes K48-ubiquination at K402 of BECN1, allowing its proteosomal degradation. Activity of SKP2 is negatively controlled by FKBP51, which regulates SKP2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SKP2 leads to autophagy activation, with increased BECN1 levels, and increased interaction between lysosomal and autophagy SNARE proteins. They identified and studied a pharmacological compound, SMIP004, which strongly inhibits SKP2. The results presented her are novel, technically sound and contribute to a better understanding of autophagy regulation.A second part of the article is dedicated to a possible therapeutic application of their data on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. MERS-CoV is a human betacoronavirus responsible of a severe viral respiratory disease, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A third of reported patients with MERS have died and no antiviral treatment is currently available. They first demonstrated that MERS CoV blocks autophagy, in particular the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, using several reliable autophagy monitoring experiments. They identified three nonstructural viral proteins which can recapitulate the block of the autophagic flux observed during viral infection. They constructed recombinant viruses deleted for these genes but unfortunately poorly characterized their phenotype.Finally they tested the effect of this SKP2 inhibitor, SMIP004 at 10µM, on MERS-CoV infection and observed an important inhibition of its multiplication. Unfortunately, they only evaluated viral genome production by RT-PCR at two different times post infection. Virus titers were not determined by plaque assay or TCID50 and no growth kinetics are presented, as expected for this kind of studies. Because a similar inhibition was observed with other compounds which interact with BECN1 and stimulate autophagy, they conclude that SMIP004 acts by stabilizing BECN1. They also tested FDA approved compounds reported to inhibit SKP2 and identified for several of them an antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. They conclude from this part of the work that inhibition of SKP2 leads to an important restriction of MERS CoV multiplication and represents an interesting therapeutic approach. This second part is quite interesting but suffers from speculative interpretations and lack of data from the literature. Some important experiments regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of SMIP004 are missing and should be added to support their interpretation of the data.In conclusion, this article reports totally new and important data on both autophagy regulation by SKP2 and on interaction between MERS-CoV and autophagy and a possible antiviral role of autophagy, which can be used as an innovative therapeutic approach.Page 4 'CoV propagation and immune evasion is highly dependent on the formation of convoluted membranes and double membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are reminiscent of autophagosomes (ref 17) pointing to a potential role of autophagy during the CoV life cycle.' In the introduction the authors improperly and incompletely reported data from the literature regarding impact of autophagy on coronavirus infection. Indeed, the presence of DMVs during Mouse Hepatitis virus infection (another betacoronavirus) has been reported in 2002 in the reference 17 cited by the authors. However, a more recent study, Regiorri et al demonstrated that DMVs are coated with the nonlipidated form of LC3 (LC3-I) and that LC3-II the autophagic marker and autophagy have no role on viral production. This was confirmed in the journal Autophagy by Zhao et al who demonstrated that MHV replication does not require Atg5. Therefore, it is established that autophagy has no role on MHV replication. However, it has been reported that autophagy negatively regulates TGEV replication (Sci Rep 2016). But another study reported a proviral role of autophagy on TGEV (Oncotarget 2016). Indeed, TGEV infection induces mitophagy to promote cell survival and possibly viral infection.Page 11 'These results points to a block of autophagic flux by MERS-CoV infection at both early (BECN1) and late steps in the pathway' Whereas data clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV infection blocks autophagic flux and leads to an accumulation of immature autophagosomes, no evidence demonstrates that early steps of autophagy are reduced by MERS-CoV infection. A decrease of BECN1 expression is not sufficient to conclude this, when in parallel they observed an increase of the total number of autophagic vesicles during infection compared to control cells ( Fig S3F) . In the article (Cottam et al 2014, ref 41), the authors concluded that the non-structural protein nsp6 of IBV, an avian coronavirus, restricts autophagosome expansion by immunofluorescence by measuring the diameter of the autophagosomes. The authors need therefore to modify this sentence.The results presented in Figure 5 clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV blocks autophagosome maturation rather that initial steps of autophagosome formation. The titer of Figure 5 is therefore not adapted to the results and should be replaced by 'blocks autophagic flux'.Page 15 and Figure 6 panels A and B 'In order to confirm the influence of p4b and p5 on virus replication, we performed loss of…for the step-wise construction of an ORF4b-and ORF5-deleted MERS-CoV' 'The deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in 10-fold lower replication efficiency 48 hours p.i. (Fig. 6B )'The characterization of the recombinant viruses presented in this study is clearly insufficient. No genome sequence analysis was reported. Growth kinetics of the different viruses showing viral titers (pfu/ml) at different times need to be added instead of measuring an inhibitory effect of the deletion ( fig 6B) . More importantly, the authors did not report that in two previous independent studies (ref 44 of this article and Almazan et al, Mbio, 2013), construction of equivalent mutant MERS-CoV (no expression of orf5 or orf4ab) led to different results. Indeed, recombinant viruses lacking orf5 expression replicated to high titers (44). Similarly, Almazan et al observed that virus titers, cpe and plaque morphology of MERS-delta5 are similar to that of parental virus. In the case of MERS-delta4ab the viral titer was only 10 fold lower at 72hpi. How the authors explain this discrepancy? This can be related to an improper way to quantify viral production. Usually viral titers are determined by plaque assay (pfu/ml) in growth kinetics at different times of infection. In this study, they use RT-PCR in supernatant to detect viral genome but this experiment does not measure viral infectivity. However, no quantification of LC3-II/LC3-I is available and the expression level of LC3-I seems important compared to other WB of the article.Panel B and C: How is the multiplication of these mutant viruses in autophagy deficient cells? If growth kinetics of mutant viruses are similar to that of parental virus, this would allow the authors to confirm the antiviral role of autophagy on MERS-CoV and to reveal a possible requirement of orf4b or orf5 to counteract it.The titer of the legend does not reflect the results. No data in this figure demonstrates that SKP2 inhibition reduces viral replication.Regarding SKP2 inhibitor, effect on viral replication is impressive, but same remark than above, growth kinetics and determination of viral titers are necessary. Moreover, to prove that the compound is acting via autophagy, effect of SMIP004 should be tested in autophagy deficient cells. This kind of approach was used for antibacterial activity of tat-beclin1 for example, in reference 46, Shoji-Kawata et al Nature 2013.Page 17 ABT-737 and Tat-Beclin both inhibit MERS-CoV replication and they 'leave the levels of BECN1 unchanged'. Therefore, the authors cannot conclude just after that 'increasing BECN1 is the relevant mechanism'. We can make the same remark on page 18, on the mechanism of SKP2 inhibitor by enhancing BECN1 levels. Effects of overexpression of BECN1 on CoV replication should be tested. A siRNA against BECN1 will confirm the involvment of BECN1 and autophagy in CoV replication.The authors need to report that several of their tested drugs have well-described activity on autophagy, such as niclosamide, valinomycin, salinomycin and gossypol. They only confirmed previous studies. Moreover, these compounds are not only SKP2 inhibitors and specific autophagy inhibitors but have other activities since for example Niclosamide increases mitochondrial fission and valinomycin is a potassium ionophore. Once again, viral replication should be explored using plaque assay and growth kinetics. Figure 7 panels B and C The unusable way to determine the antiviral activity does not valorize the impressive results. Even if all these drugs inhibit SKP2, they have other activities. Therefore, the title needs to be modified unless impact of SKP2 is tested by gene silencing.Discussion page 21 line 5 Same remark than above, unless they are testing SKP2 knock down, the authors cannot conclude on impact of SKP2 inhibition on viral multiplication. The authors should report in the discussion that autophagy has no antiviral effect on MHV, another betacoronavirus.In conclusion regarding the antiviral activities the authors clearly identified components able to block MERS-CoV replication but the mechanism by SKP2 inhibition is not so far demonstrated.Minor remarks: Figure 1 '(C-F) FKP51…. Transfected with vector control… or FKP51' add (Co) after control Figure 3 panel I Information regarding $$ is missing in the legend. Unfortunate that only LLP degradation was tested with siRNA against SKP2 and no other readout for autophagy such as LC3 of p62.Page 10 'Targeting SKP2 INCREASED protein degradation'Page 11 'we aimed to test if blocking the SKP2 dependent autophagy inhibition influences CoV replication'. To improve the understanding of this sentence, it is better to say 'if stimulation of autophagy by SKP2 inhibitor influences MERS-CoV replication. Add MERS instead of just CoV because, it was tested only for this coronavirus.Page 13-15 Several mistakes in the labelling of panels for figure S3 Page 13 S3DE is S3EF; S3F is in fact S3G, S3G is S3H page 15 S3H is S3I I is J and J is K Moreover in Figure S3K what is the condition 'Co'? sam question for Figure S5 panel I. where are the white histograms? pages 2 4 15 17 20 22 The word 'propagation' is used several times in the text, but corresponds in fact to viral cell-to-cell spread and is not tested here. It should be replaced by viral multiplication or production.Finally the title does not totally reflect data presented in the article, because impact of SKP2 on viral replication has been explored only using compounds which have other activities than just inhibiting SKP2.Reviewer #3: Remarks to the Author: Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic pathway that can mediate degradation of obsolete organelles, misfolded proteins and other cargo like viral components. Being a destructive process, autophagy has to be tightly controlled. Indeed, intricate signalling pathways regulate both induction and flux rates of autophagy. Recent reports have highlighted the impact of autophagy on many cellular processes and its role as an anti-viral mechanism. Gassen et al had previously identified FKBP51 as a beclin-binding protein, which mediates induction of autophagy (Gassen et al, 2014&2015). Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1. Finally, this study provides novel data on how to combat viral infections (here MERS-CoV) using insights gained from understanding the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and virus-autophagy interplay. However, occasionally it feels like there are two (interesting) separate stories existing side-by-side (Mechanism of FKBP51/SKP2, Interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV), which need to be tied together more tightly. A few specific issues need to be addressed as well: Major: 1. Treatment with drugs can have multiple effects on viral replication. Therefore, even though all used drugs presumably target a similar pathway, it has to be made sure that autophagy is responsible for viral attenuation. The authors should conduct experiments in which autophagy is induced (e.g. by mentioned drugs), but the effects of this induction are blocked. For example, can the growth attenuation be rescued if autophagic turnover is blocked by chloroquine, or LC3B conjugation inhibited by ATG5 KO/KD? Furthermore, the chosen drugs used to inhibit SKP2 (even though it is backed up by literature) need direct evidence that SKP2-dependent beclin-1 ubiquitination is reduced. 2. The interesting data on MERS-CoV prompts the question, how do other viruses, which are known to be sensitive towards autophagy, react towards inhibition of SKP2. Experiments exploring the effect of the drugs on e.g. Sindbis Virus or HIV-1 replication should clarify that issue and would complement the MERS-CoV data and make it less focused on treating a single virus with a system potentially applicable for other viral pathogens. 3. Fig. 2C : To show that SKP2 is the E3 ligase which ubiquitinates beclin-1, the authors should include a SKP2 E3-ligase null mutant and monitor beclin-1 levels/degradation. The effect observed in Fig. 2C -F should be rescued by MG132 treatment, to prove its proteasome dependent degradation. 4. Fig. 3 : A few additional details have to be clarified: Is Beclin-1 K402R resistant towards degradation induced by either PHLPPi treatment or SKP2 overexpression? Since AKT1 is involved in the cascade, does pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 lead to stabilization of beclin-1? Minor: 1. The abstract needs rephrasing to emphasise the achievements of this paper in a more cohesive and appealing way. The current abstract undersells the story. 2. The title of the paper could be shortened to sound less convoluted. 3. Writing of the results section (first part) might need improvement to make it more accessible. Furthermore, mechanistic details could be presented more cohesively to focus on the achievements of the paper. 4. Please add size markers to all the western blots. 5. Fig. 1 B: Stabilization of beclin-1 levels by MG132 has to be compared to NH4Cl treatment, to rule out turnover by autophagy. 6. Fig. 2A ,B: It would be interesting to see the whole Western Blots (especially for USP18 and USP36, including the input). 7. Fig. 2C ,D: Since SKP2 is regulated by phosphorylation. It would be curious to see how phosphomimetic and phospho-null mutants of SKP2 would impact beclin-1 stability. 8. Fig. 3 I: Please show one exemplary western blot of a protein degraded by autophagy. 9. Fig. 4 E: Please add a quantification for the western blots as shown in the figure. 10. Fig. 5D and E: Both figure panels could be moved to the supplements, as the effect observed is only marginal and other data presented is stronger. 11. Fig. 6A : While interesting, the sketch could be moved to the supplements. 12. Fig. 6G : Could be moved to the supplements 13. Fig. 6E : While manual counting is certainly being used a lot, these assays could be alternatively quantified using flow cytometry to get data, which might be less biased by manual observation. 14. Fig. 7 A We thank reviewer #1 for the insightful, critical and constructive comments. We performed new experiments to address these comments, and moderated our conclusions as suggested where necessary, while balancing the modifications keeping comments of reviewer #3 in mind who suggested to better highlight the merits of the study.Major Issues Comment 1. 'Throughout the report, the panels in the figures do not correlate with the references in the text. While the figure # is correct, the letter they relate to in the text is incorrect especially in all of the MERS-CoV figures.'We apologize for these errors; we double-checked to make sure all the numbers and letters in the text correlate to the right figure and panel. We agree with the reviewer. In order to directly show that virus production (on request of reviewer 2 we are avoiding the word 'propagation', because this refers to spreading from cell to cell which we do not show directly) is affected we determined the reduction of plaque forming units/ml in parallel to virus RNA copies per ml. Based on this comment and comments from the other reviewers, we performed new experiments and now display the fold difference (log10 scale) of the RNA analysis (genome equivalents, GE) and the plaque forming units, as well as the raw data of the genome equivalents in the new Figures 9B and S9A -C. Figure S9A shows the unprocessed data of the detected genome equivalents per ml, which are in good agreement with the GE data of the first submission. Clearly, the RNA analysis and the determination of the pfus revealed the same pattern of activity, indicating that both assays are valid to investigate the influence of autophagy inducers on MERS-CoV replication/growth. We chose to examine the role of autophagy on MERS-CoV growth in multi-cycle replication assays in order to identify meaningful effects that reflect physiological conditions. Only a few MERS-CoV particles are necessary to establish an infection in the respiratory tract. All assays were, therefore, performed with a low MOI. Importantly, we used two different time points (e.g. 24 and 48 hours post infection) to account for effects during the exponential growth of the virus (24 hours) and the plateau of virus production (48 hours). Comment 3. The control protein for Figure 2 is TRAF6 to show that there is no effect on BECN1 protein levels via an additional ubiquitination protein. However TRAF6 is not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. It should be shown as a comparison to vector alone.We performed the requested experiment and replaced panels E and F of Figure 2 . On the request of reviewer #3, these panels now also display conditions including the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Similarly to the cycloheximide assay (panels C and D), TRAF6 did not affect protein stability of Beclin1.Legend of Figure 2E ,F: 'The conditions of C,D were also used in the pulse-chase assay, performed as in Fig. 1E ,F, to determine BECN1 stability.' Figure 4D where 3-MA has no effect on protein levels. This is not discussed in the text.'Response:3-MA was used at a concentration of 10 mM, which is the concentration typically used for the inhibition of autophagy (for example Cell 2010; 140: 313-326). We are aware of the reports that 3-MA can have effects beyond blocking autophagy, and even promote autophagy under certain conditions. This is also stated in the third edition of the 'Guidelines for the use and interpretation of assays for monitoring autophagy' (AUTOPHAGY 2016; 12: 1-222), page 54: 'For example, 3-MA is commonly used to inhibit starvation-or rapamycin-induced autophagy, but it has no effect on BECN1-independent forms of autophagy, and some data indicate that this compound can also have stimulatory effects on autophagy'. In our case, the goal was to investigate BECN1-dependent autophagy, for which 3-MA should work according to these guidelines. Moreover, we do see inhibition of induced autophagy, because the enhanced proteolysis of long-lived proteins (induced by si-RNA targeting Skp2 that enhances BECN1 protein levels, Fig We changed the manuscript by providing the concentration of 3-MA in the figure legends as well as in the methods section, by correcting the description of the turnover assay in the results section, and by providing more citations. We noted that there was a wrong wording in our description of the turn-over assay, which may have misled this reviewer, and we apologize for this. The section now reads ( Figure  3I is now Figure 4M ):'In order to verify that reduced SKP2 activity drives autophagy in our cellular set-up, we used siRNA and determined the degradation of long-lived proteins 48 . Targeting SKP2 increased proteolysis, but not in the presence of the autophagy inhibitor 3methyladenine (3-MA, Fig. 4M ). Furthermore, we observed decreased levels of p62 (Fig. S1G) , which typically goes along with enhanced autophagy48. All these data are consistent with an inhibitory effect of SKP2 on autophagy regulated by a phosphorylation cascade involving FKBP51, PHLPP and AKT1.Comment 5. 'For Figure 4 , there are several controls missing in the figure. First, there are no toxicity controls showing that the range of each inhibitor used is below significant cell toxicity levels. Secondly, the control in 4D using HBSS as an inducer of autophagy is not shown. Please show experimental evidence that in this experiment HBSS induces autophagy. Third, in 4E, BECN1 levels increase with all drugs; however LC3B increases with only 2 of them, and there doesn't seem to be a change in P62. There should be some correlation between these results but there is no consistency.'Response:To 5.1: Figure S2A displays the toxicity controls and shows that each inhibitor is used at a concentration below significant cell toxicity.To 5.2: We performed flux assays with HBSS and BafA1 which confirmed the induction of autophagic flux by HBSS. These data are now presented as Figure S2D : Figure 5E , for the WCE blot it is not clear how you can observe both SNAP29 and STX17 in the same blot where it does not show up in the IP blots. Shouldn't they be in the same complex since they are crosslinked so they show as 1 band? The order of 5F and G should be reversed. And 5F is not clear. I assume it is a quantitation of 5G, however it does not match the data in 5G. The relationship between ATG14 monomeric and oligomeric forms and autophagy is not made clear. Are there published data showing oliogomeric ATG14 actively inhibits autophagosome to lysosome fusion, or simply that it fails to promote fusion? Also, if MERS is inhibiting oligomerization, I would expect there to be an increase in monomer, which is not seen. Does total ATG14 amount change? Please clarify.'Response:To 6.1: We apologize for the errors in Figure numbering , which we corrected.To 6.2 Figure 5E : WCE in Figure 5E (now Fig. 6H (page 14) :'In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosomelysosome fusion 7 . Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7-8mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 (Fig. S2H, I) .'Comment 7. 'The MERS-CoV infections experiments in the supplemental figure S3 is also confusing. First, the cropped cells in S3E do not line up, please clean up the cropping.

And the correlation should be with virus titer not mRNA since the autophagy effect would be expected to be on virus egress not transcription?'Response:To 7.1 and 7.2: We improved the example images of Figure S3E (now figure 6D) 8A ). In the supplement, we also included the unprocessed data showing the GE/m (S5A). In Figure 9B ,C we establish that GE/ml and PFU/ml can both be used to obtain an estimate of the virus growth.Comment 8.

Since this is a key feature of the model, it would be important to show that SKP2 siRNA or inhibition by drugs effects the ATG14 oligo/monomer relationship.'Response: Figure 8D ,E (former figure 6F) shows the effect of SKP2 inhibition on ATG14 oligomerisation in MERS-CoV infected cells. The inhibitor produced more ATG14 oligomers, but had no effect on the amount of ATG14 monomers. As mentioned in our response to major point 6, we find the absence of effect on ATG14 monomers in the presence of pronounced effects on ATG14 oligomers difficult to explain, but this has been observed by others in different settings as well. The idea is not that SKP2 causes ATG14 oligomerisation directly, but that this has recently been shown as crucial step in functional autophagy (Nature 2015 520: 563-566) and thus was included in our analyses.We mention this now first in the results to new Figure S2H , as also explained in our response to comment 6.2: 'In addition, it has been shown that ATG14 oligomerizes to dimers and tetramers, which is essential for autophagy by promoting STX17 binding and autophagosome-lysosome fusion 7 . Using capillary-based electrophoresis allowing for better resolution at high molecular weight we observed ATG14 oligomerization to 7-8mers, which was enhanced by SMIP004 (Fig. S2H,I) '.Further, the description of panel D in the legend of Figure 9 (former Figure 7) now is: 'Summary scheme: SKP2 leads to K48-linked poly-ubiquitination and thus degradation of BECN1. The effect of SKP2 can be diminished in two ways, either by chemical inhibition or by FKBP51, which scaffolds protein interactions ultimately leading to SKP2 inactivation through inhibiting its phosphorylation. Both scenarios enhance autophagy, which involves ATG14 oligomerization (probably 7-8mers) as newly described essential step in functional autophagy 7 . MERS-CoV reduces autophagy through distinct viral proteins leading to blockade of autophagosomelysosome fusion and ATG14 oligomerization. Compounds inhibiting SKP2 reinstate autophagy and efficiently reduce viral production.'Minor comment 1. ' Figure 1B . The whole cell lysates shown in the 2nd and 3rd lane for BECN1 (3rd blot down) are different however they are the same in the IP blot for BECN1 (2nd blot down). Please correct or explain why there are differences.'We replaced the blot with a more suitable example:'Gassen et al reported here a very complete study of a novel regulation of autophagy by SKP2, a E3 ubiquitin ligase. They nicely demonstrated that SKP2 targets BECN1, an autophagy protein which is involved in autophagosome formation and maturation in two different complexes. SKP2 executes K48-ubiquination at K402 of BECN1, allowing its proteosomal degradation. Activity of SKP2 is negatively controlled by FKBP51, which regulates SKP2 phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of SKP2 leads to autophagy activation, with increased BECN1 levels, and increased interaction between lysosomal and autophagy SNARE proteins. They identified and studied a pharmacological compound, SMIP004, which strongly inhibits SKP2. The results presented her are novel, technically sound and contribute to a better understanding of autophagy regulation.A second part of the article is dedicated to a possible therapeutic application of their data on Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. MERS-CoV is a human betacoronavirus responsible of a severe viral respiratory disease, first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. A third of reported patients with MERS have died and no antiviral treatment is currently available. They first demonstrated that MERS CoV blocks autophagy, in particular the fusion between autophagosome and lysosome, using several reliable autophagy monitoring experiments. They identified three nonstructural viral proteins which can recapitulate the block of the autophagic flux observed during viral infection. They constructed recombinant viruses deleted for these genes but unfortunately poorly characterized their phenotype.Finally they tested the effect of this SKP2 inhibitor, SMIP004 at 10µM, on MERS-CoV infection and observed an important inhibition of its multiplication. Unfortunately, they only evaluated viral genome production by RT-PCR at two different times post infection. Virus titers were not determined by plaque assay or TCID50 and no growth kinetics are presented, as expected for this kind of studies. Because a similar inhibition was observed with other compounds which interact with BECN1 and stimulate autophagy, they conclude that SMIP004 acts by stabilizing BECN1. They also tested FDA approved compounds reported to inhibit SKP2 and identified for several of them an antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. They conclude from this part of the work that inhibition of SKP2 leads to an important restriction of MERS CoV multiplication and represents an interesting therapeutic approach. This second part is quite interesting but suffers from speculative interpretations and lack of data from the literature. Some important experiments regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of SMIP004 are missing and should be added to support their interpretation of the data. In conclusion, this article reports totally new and important data on both autophagy regulation by SKP2 and on interaction between MERS-CoV and autophagy and a possible antiviral role of autophagy, which can be used as an innovative therapeutic approach.'We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. We believe to have addressed the major concerns of this reviewer by i) characterizing the phenotype of the MERS- The authors need therefore to modify this sentence.'We modified and expanded the description as follows (üage 14, former Fig. S3F is now Fig. 6C ):'Infection with MERS-CoV further led to an increase of the total number of phagocytic vesicles (sum of AL + AP) per cell (Fig. 6C,D) . However, the number of successfully formed AL was reduced significantly, indicating that AP can form but not fuse with lysosomes when cells are infected. A fusion block was also evidenced by the significantly reduced ATG14 oligomerization, essential for AP-lysosome fusion 7 , in infected cells (Fig. 6E,F) and by the increase of the autophagy target P62 (Fig.  S3C ).''The results presented in Figure 5 clearly demonstrated that MERS-CoV blocks autophagosome maturation rather that initial steps of autophagosome formation. The titer of Figure 5 is therefore not adapted to the results and should be replaced by 'blocks autophagic flux'.'We agree and modified the title of ''In order to confirm the influence of p4b and p5 on virus replication, we performed loss of…for the step-wise construction of an ORF4b-and ORF5-deleted MERS-CoV' 'The deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in 10-fold lower replication efficiency 48 hours p.i. (Fig. 6B )'The characterization of the recombinant viruses presented in this study is clearly insufficient. No genome sequence analysis was reported. Growth kinetics of the different viruses showing viral titers (pfu/ml) at different times need to be added instead of measuring an inhibitory effect of the deletion (fig 6B) .'We agree that 'inhibitory effect' might have been a less precise wording for Figure  6B . Usually viral titers are determined by plaque assay (pfu/ml) in growth kinetics at different times of infection. In this study, they use RT-PCR in supernatant to detect viral genome but this experiment does not measure viral infectivity.'As shown above, we reproduced the experiment independently and now include the PFU/ml and the GE/ml data in the manuscript (Fig. S4E,F) .…' Deletion of p4b or p5 resulted in reduced MERS-CoV growth. These results differ from previous observations, which may be related to different cell lines and cDNA clone construction strategies 72, 73 . In addition, we used a very low MOI and a type I IFN-deficient cell line (VeroB4), which allows to determine minor growth differences.'… Comment Figure 6 panel CThe authors concluded that mutant viruses do not control autophagy compared to parental virus. However, no quantification of LC3-II/LC3-I is available and the expression level of LC3-I seems important compared to other WB of the article.We now provide quantification of LC3BII/I along with the western blot ( Figure  S4C Comment Panel B and C: How is the multiplication of these mutant viruses in autophagy deficient cells? If growth kinetics of mutant viruses are similar to that of parental virus, this would allow the authors to confirm the antiviral role of autophagy on MERS-CoV and to reveal a possible requirement of orf4b or orf5 to counteract it.Response:the other hand does not support the conclusion that p4b or p5 are responsible for this effect. Therefore, we moderated our conclusion to this point. The results are presented in the new figure S4E ,F which we copied above in response to another issue of the reviewer.'Deletion of p4b and p5 led to a decreased accumulation of P62 and LC3B-II/I, suggesting that both proteins contribute to the inhibition of the autophagic flux (Fig.  S4C,D) . The p4b-and p5-deleted viruses as well as the WT control virus grew to higher levels in ATG5 knockout Vero cells compared to WT cells (Fig. S4E,F) . However, the p4b and p5-deleted viruses showed overall an up to 10-fold decreased replication in both WT and ATG5 knockout cells compared to WT virus suggesting a p4b-and p5-dependent attenuation of virus replication that is independent of ATG5directed autophagy.' Comment Figure 6 The titer of the legend does not reflect the results. No data in this figure demonstrates that SKP2 inhibition reduces viral replication.We agree and took care to make sure the titles better reflect the figures. With the new data, figures were rearranged, so figure 6 now largely is integrated into figure 8, but not entirely.'Regarding SKP2 inhibitor, effect on viral replication is impressive, but same remark than above, growth kinetics and determination of viral titers are necessary.'In the revised manuscript we included a modified version showing the fold change difference between DMSO vs Skp2i-treated cells (now figure 8A ). In the supplement (Fig. S5A) , we also include the unprocessed data showing the GE/ml. As outlined above ( Figure S4E ,F) and below ( Figures 9B, S9A-C) , we showed for several cases that GE/ml can be used as a surrogate for PFU/ml.New figure 8A and S5A:Comment Page 15, continued:'Moreover, to prove that the compound is acting via autophagy, effect of SMIP004 should be tested in autophagy deficient cells. This kind of approach was used for antibacterial activity of tat-beclin1 for example, in reference 46, Shoji-Kawata et al Nature 2013. 'We agree that testing the effect of SMIP004 in autophagy-deficient cells would add useful information. We actually considered performing the mentioned experiment; however, due to reconstruction work of the BSL3 laboratory during the revision, we were not able to perform this experiment in a timely manner. We reasoned that other experiments requested by the reviewers (e.g. providing pfus) needed to be given higher priority in using the very limited BSL3 laboratory availability. all these compounds might have additional effects and mention this in the discussion, where we adapted our conclusions (page 25): 'From the present results, therapeutic induction of autophagy by inhibition of SKP2 emerges as a novel approach. We should note that all the substances tested here have or may have additional targets. While we cannot exclude the possibility that for each of the compounds it is this additional target that is responsible for the antiviral effect, we consider this scenario as less likely; this assessment is also based on the observation of the antiviral effects of compounds targeting BECN1, which we establish here as client of SKP2.' Furthermore, we changed the title of the manuscript to: 'SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection'.'ABT-737 and Tat-Beclin both inhibit MERS-CoV replication and they 'leave the levels of BECN1 unchanged'. Therefore, the authors cannot conclude just after that 'increasing BECN1 is the relevant mechanism'. We can make the same remark on page 18, on the mechanism of SKP2 inhibitor by enhancing BECN1 levels. Effects of overexpression of BECN1 on CoV replication should be tested. A siRNA against BECN1 will confirm the involvment of BECN1 and autophagy in CoV replication.'We agree that the conclusion was not stringent the way it was presented. All we can state is that another and independent mechanism that enhances BECN1's activity in autophagy elicits the same antiviral effect on MERS. This suggests that of the activities potentially elicited by enhancing BECN1 protein levels it is autophagy that is relevant, but it does not prove it. As mentioned above, cotransfection experiments (including overexpression of Beclin1) in combination with viral infection were not successful, unfortunately, in particular using any kind of siRNA (which also would risk to generate off-target effects). We refined the description in the results section (page 20):'Our data strongly suggest that of the potential mechanisms of SKP2i, it is the increase of BECN1-directed autophagy that reduces MERS-CoV multiplication. If this is correct, other ways of enhancing BECN1's effect on autophagy should elicit similar effects. Therefore, we used two recently introduced tools to enhance BECN1 function in autophagy: the BH3 mimetic ABT-737 and a BECN1-derived peptide 58,59 . These compounds, in contrast to SKP2i, do not change the levels of BECN1, but increase autophagy by redirecting BECN1 function towards the autophagy pathway, which we confirmed in VeroB4 cells (Fig. S7B-D,G) . Enhanced autophagy was indicated by the increase of LC3B-II/I (Fig. S7E,G) and the reduction of P62 (Fig. S7F-G) . This was paralleled by inhibition of MERS-CoV replication by up to 60-fold in the case of the BECN1-peptide (TAT-B) (Fig. S7H) and 10-fold in the case of ABT-737 at 48 h p.i. (Fig. S7I) . These results are in accordance with the notion that increasing BECN1 acts through enhancing autophagy as the relevant mechanism for the antiviral effects of SKP2 in vitro.'The authors need to report that several of their tested drugs have well-described activity on autophagy, such as niclosamide, valinomycin, salinomycin and gossypol. They only confirmed previous studies. Moreover, these compounds are not only SKP2 inhibitors and specific autophagy inhibitors but have other activities since for example Niclosamide increases mitochondrial fission and valinomycin is a potassium ionophore. Once again, viral replication should be explored using plaque assay and growth kinetics.We agree that autophagy induction of these compounds has been shown before. This actually is the reason why the compounds were chosen, as mentioned in the text. The intention was to begin to explore, whether there might be readily available drugs that tap into the pathway presented in the manuscript. We modified the results section, because it could have been misunderstood (page 22):'These results encouraged us to test other potential inhibitors of SKP2. Autophagyinducing, FDA-approved drugs and drugs from clinical trials were of particular interest as these could become more readily available for treatment in humans. Of note, valinomycin (VAL), which has been shown to target SARS-CoV in vitro 50,61 , is also known to act as an SKP2 inhibitor 49 .' Figures 9B, S9A -C). Raw data (absolute quantification of viral RNA as 'genome equivalents, GE' and infectious particles as 'plaque forming units, PFU', all presented now in the new Figures S9A,C) of this experiment showed that the difference between GE and PFU is 1000-fold irrespective of the drug used. In other words, whether we used real-time RT-PCR or the pfu assay did not matter, because we obtained the same pattern among all drugs. Therefore, the determination of EC50 values of VAL, NIC and SKP2i was performed only by real-time RT-PCR. Figure 7 panels B and C 'The unusable way to determine the antiviral activity does not valorize the impressive results. Even if all these drugs inhibit SKP2, they have other activities. Therefore, the title needs to be modified unless impact of SKP2 is tested by gene silencing.'Following the reviewer´s suggestion, we changed the title of Figure 9 (~previous  figure 7) to 'Test of potential SKP2 inhibitors for their effects on autophagy and viral replication', because silencing of SKP2 by siRNA did not work and appears to be toxic for the cells, unfortunately. We copied the new figures 9B and S9A-C (the experiments of the previous figure 7B have been repeated and expanded to include pfus) in our response to the comment before.In addition, we changed the title of the manuscript to: 'SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection'.Comment Discussion page 21 line 5 'Same remark than above, unless they are testing SKP2 knock down, the authors cannot conclude on impact of SKP2 inhibition on viral multiplication.The authors should report in the discussion that autophagy has no antiviral effect on MHV, another betacoronavirus.'We agree that the conclusion only goes as far as the specificity of the compounds. As detailed above, we modified the title and text accordingly. MHV is now mentioned in the introduction (copied in response to an earlier point above).In conclusion regarding the antiviral activities the authors clearly identified components able to block MERS-CoV replication but the mechanism by SKP2 inhibition is not so far demonstrated.As detailed in the response to the specific points above, we modified the text to moderate this specific claim.Minor remarks: Comment Figure 1 ''(C-F) FKP51…. Transfected with vector control… or FKP51' add (Co) after control'We modified the figure panels as requested. Figure 3 panel I 'Information regarding $$ is missing in the legend. Unfortunate that only LLP degradation was tested with siRNA against SKP2 and no other readout for autophagy such as LC3 of p62.'We added the missing information to the figure legend (former panel I of figure 3 is  now panel M of figure 4) . Additional effects observed with the siRNA were the decrease of Beclin1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2I) , the increase in Beclin1 levels and stability (Figs. 2G, J-M, S1C) , the increase in LC3BII/I (Figs. 2G, S1C ) the increase of ATG14 oligomerisation (Fig. S2H,I) , the restoration of autophagic flux in MERS-CoV infected cells (Fig. S7J) , and the decrease of p62 (new Fig. S1G) . We apologize for this error, which must have been confusing. The sentence is now corrected.''we aimed to test if blocking the SKP2 dependent autophagy inhibition influences CoV replication'. To improve the understanding of this sentence, it is better to say 'if stimulation of autophagy by SKP2 inhibitor influences MERS-CoV replication. Add MERS instead of just CoV because, it was tested only for this coronavirus.'We agree with the reviewer and thank for this kind suggestion. This section, marking the transition to the viral investigations, is now completely revised, and this specific sentence disappeared. The transition now reads: 'Results up to this point suggested that activity of BECN1 and thereby autophagy is limited by SKP2, which in turn is activated by AKT1 ( 46 and Fig. 3/4) . Since MERS-CoV has been shown to enhance phosphorylation of AKT1 25 , it might reduce autophagy.'Comment Page 13-15'Several mistakes in the labelling of panels for figure S3Page 13 S3DE is S3EF; S3F is in fact S3G, S3G is S3H page 15 S3H is S3I I is J and J is K Figure S3K what is the condition 'Co'? same question for Figure Comment pages 2 4 15 17 20 22 'The word 'propagation' is used several times in the text, but corresponds in fact to viral cell-to-cell spread and is not tested here. It should be replaced by viral multiplication or production.' Response:The revised manuscript includes the detection of infectious units using virus plaque assays. As we transferred cell-free virus-containing supernatants to non-infected cells to determine the amount of infectious units, we think that now it would be appropriate to use word virus propagation. Nevertheless, we modified our wording.Final comment 'Finally the title does not totally reflect data presented in the article, because impact of SKP2 on viral replication has been explored only using compounds which have other activities than just inhibiting SKP2.'We changed the title to 'SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection'.Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic pathway that can mediate degradation of obsolete organelles, misfolded proteins and other cargo like viral components. Being a destructive process, autophagy has to be tightly controlled. Indeed, intricate signalling pathways regulate both induction and flux rates of autophagy. Recent reports have highlighted the impact of autophagy on many cellular processes and its role as an anti-viral mechanism.Gassen et al had previously identified FKBP51 as a beclin-binding protein, which mediates induction of autophagy (Gassen et al, 2014&2015) . Continuing their work on autophagy, they elaborate on the mechanism. FKBP51 is assembling an autophagy-promoting complex, which deactivates/dephosphorylates the E3 ligase SKP2. Inactivated SKP2 no longer mediates K48-linked polyubiquitination of beclin-1 thereby stabilizing its protein levels and promoting autophagy. Furthermore, the authors characterise the interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV. While infection inhibits autophagic flux via several viral proteins, exogenous activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 combats MERS-CoV infection. Experiments characterising autophagy are conducted in a convincing way and the data supports the claims of the authors. The paper by Gassen et al features an elegant exploration of the complicated mechanism of FKBP51 and links SKP2 to beclin-1. They manage to assemble puzzle pieces from previously published studies about the regulation of SKP2 (e.g. Rodier et al, 2008 and others) complemented by their own data to suggest assembly of a multi-protein complex that regulates stability of beclin-1. Finally, this study provides novel data on how to combat viral infections (here MERS-CoV) using insights gained from understanding the molecular mechanism of autophagy induction and virus-autophagy interplay. However, occasionally it feels like there are two (interesting) separate stories existing side-byside (Mechanism of FKBP51/SKP2, Interplay between autophagy and MERS-CoV), which need to be tied together more tightly.A few specific issues need to be addressed as well:Major:'Treatment with drugs can have multiple effects on viral replication. Therefore, even though all used drugs presumably target a similar pathway, it has to be made sure that autophagy is responsible for viral attenuation. The authors should conduct experiments in which autophagy is induced (e.g. by mentioned drugs), but the effects of this induction are blocked. For example, can the growth attenuation be rescued if autophagic turnover is blocked by chloroquine, or LC3B conjugation inhibited by ATG5 KO/KD? Furthermore, the chosen drugs used to inhibit SKP2 (even though it is backed up by literature) need direct evidence that SKP2-dependent beclin-1 ubiquitination is reduced.'We tried to use chloroquine, but this turned out to be toxic for the cells. Furthermore, ATG5 KD (or any other transfection experiment, in particular siRNA transfection) was not successful in combination with viral infection. Thus, we constructed ATG5 KO in VeroB4 cells and found that MERS-CoV replicates better in these cells. As mentioned in our response to reviewer 2, we agree that testing the effect of SMIP004 in autophagy-deficient cells would be useful. We actually considered performing the mentioned experiment; however, due to reconstruction work of the BSL3 laboratory during the revision, we were not able to perform this experiment in a timely manner. We reasoned that other experiments requested by the reviewers (e.g. providing pfus) needed to be given higher priority in using the very limited BSL3 laboratory availability. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that a) SMIP004 replication. We agree though, that all these compounds might have additional effects and mention this in the discussion, where we adapted our conclusions (page 25): 'From the present results, therapeutic induction of autophagy by inhibition of SKP2 emerges as a novel approach. We should note that all the substances tested here have or may have additional targets. While we cannot exclude the possibility that for each of the compounds it is this additional target that is responsible for the antiviral effect, we consider this scenario as less likely; this assessment is also based on the observation of the antiviral effects of compounds targeting BECN1, which we establish here as client of SKP2.'In line with these considerations, we changed the title of the manuscript to 'SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection'. This title leaves open which exact molecular pathway might be responsible for the effect of these inhibitors.'The interesting data on MERS-CoV prompts the question, how do other viruses, which are known to be sensitive towards autophagy, react towards inhibition of SKP2. Experiments exploring the effect of the drugs on e.g. Sindbis Virus or HIV-1 replication should clarify that issue and would complement the MERS-CoV data and make it less focused on treating a single virus with a system potentially applicable for other viral pathogens.' Sindbis virus also turned out to be somewhat sensitive towards SKP2 inhibition, even though much less pronounced than MERS-CoV. This may be explained by a differential interaction of both viruses with the autophagic flux. The Sindbis data are now included in the manuscript as Figure We observed that SKP2 null MEFs grow extremely slow. Therefore, we used siRNA against SKP2 as before (the efficiency is documented in Figs 2G/S1C). We performed all the requested experiments and found that siRNA targeting SKP2 increased the stability of Beclin1 and ectopic overexpression of SKP2 had no effect in the presence of MG132, proving a proteasomal-dependent effect. In addition, to more thoroughly address this question we also assessed ubiquitination of Beclin1 in combination with siRNA against SKP2. These data are now included in Figure Legend to Figure 2C ,D: SKP2 affects BECN1 stability. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing SKP2 or TRAF6 and exposed to MG132 (10 µM, 2 h) where indicated and to cycloheximide (CHX, 30 µg/mL) after 72 h for the durations indicated to monitor the decay of BECN1.Legend to Figure 2E ,F: The conditions of C,D were also used in the pulse-chase assay, performed as in Fig. 1E ,F, to determine BECN1 stability.Legend to Figure 2J -M: The stability assays of the panels C-F were performed to determine the effect of SKP2-targeting siRNA on BECN1 stability. All graphs (showing the means ± SEM) and all western blots are representative of three independent experiments. Legend to Figure 2I : Knock-down of SKP2 by siRNA decreases BECN1 ubiquitination (assay as in Fig. 1B) . Representative blots are shown. ' Fig. 3 : A few additional details have to be clarified: Is Beclin-1 K402R resistant towards degradation induced by either PHLPPi treatment or SKP2 overexpression? Since AKT1 is involved in the cascade, does pharmacological inhibition of AKT1 lead to stabilization of beclin-1?'We compared the stability of Beclin1 WT and the K402R mutant in the cycloheximide assay, including the PHLPP inhibitor. We found that the K402R exhibited greater stability in comparison to WT Beclin1, and further resisted degradation induced by PHLPPi. We also tested the effect of two different Akt1 inhibitors on Beclin1 stability. Both inhibitors increased the stability of Beclin1. These data are now presented as figure 4G -J:Legend to Figure 4G -J: The cycloheximide protein stability assay was performed (as in Fig. 1C,D) to evaluate the effect of PHLPPi on K402-BECN1 in comparison to wt BECN1 (G,H) and to test the effects of AKT1 inhibitors (AktiX and MK2206) on wt BECN1 (I,J).The abstract needs rephrasing to emphasise the achievements of this paper in a more cohesive and appealing way. The current abstract undersells the story.We thank the reviewer for the kind comment. We tried to emphasize the achievements while avoiding overstatements. Combined with the other reviewers' comments, and in line with this comment, we tried to make sure that the core of our findings comes across, which is a novel pathway for the induction of autophagy. The potential usefulness of compounds addressing this pathway in fighting MERS-CoV infection serves more as an example of possible applications. Whether or not MERS-CoV has evolved mechanisms to tone down autophagy probably is less relevant in this context, but it is a question that naturally comes up and this is why we explored this also. The abstract now focusses more on the novel pathway leading to autophagy induction: 'Beclin1 (BECN1) is a key regulator of autophagy. We here identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes lysine-48-linked polyubiquitination of BECN1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation. FK506 binding protein 51 associates with and stabilizes BECN1 by scaffolding the assembly of a hetero-complex involving PHLPP, AKT1, SKP2 and BECN1 that limits phosphorylation and thus activity of SKP2. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of SKP2 decreases BECN1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging and lethal human respiratory virus for which no specific treatment is available. We found that MERS-CoV multiplication results in reduced BECN1 levels and blocks the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes. Inhibitors of SKP2 not only enhanced autophagy but also reduced the replication of MERS-CoV up to 28,000-fold. The SKP2-BECN1 link constitutes a novel target for host-directed antiviral drugs and possibly other autophagy-sensitive conditions.'Minor comment 2:The title of the paper could be shortened to sound less convoluted.We changed the title to: 'SKP2 attenuates autophagy through Beclin1-ubiquitination and its inhibitors combat MERS-Coronavirus infection'. We tried to simplify the title by constructing it along the two parts (novel mechanism of autophagy regulation and potential application to treatment). As we describe a novel mechanism regarding the SKP2-dependent control of autophagy and additionally show that the induction of autophagy by SKP2 inhibitors has a pronounced effect on MERS-CoV infection we would like to keep both subjects in the title.Writing of the results section (first part) might need improvement to make it more accessible. Furthermore, mechanistic details could be presented more cohesively to focus on the achievements of the paper.Thank you for the kind comment. We rewrote the results section along the lines laid out in the response to minor comment 2.Minor comment 4:'Please add size markers to all the western blots.'We added size markers to all western blots of figure 1. In our opinion, this makes the figure look very busy, so we suggest to refrain from this in the other figures.Minor comment 5: ' Fig. 1 B: Stabilization of beclin-1 levels by MG132 has to be compared to NH4Cl treatment, to rule out turnover by autophagy.'We included NH 4 Response:We include data on p62 as example of a protein that is degraded by autophagy. These data are now included in Figure S1G .New Fig. S1G :Legend to Figure S1G : The quantification is shown in figure S2E -G (referring to Fig. 5E, former figure 4E ).Legend to figure S2E-G: VeroB4 cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors (C1 (3.3 µM), SMIP004 (10 µM), SMER3 (5 µM)) and the indicated protein levels were determined (mean + SEM of three independent experiments; quantification to the western blots in Fig. 5E ).Minor comment 10:' Fig. 5D and E: Both figure panels could be moved to the supplements, as the effect observed is only marginal and other data presented is stronger.'Response: Figure 5D is now figure S3D . We agree the effect shown in former figure 5E is quite small. It is hard to predict though, to what degree SNARE protein associations have to change to produce a significant effect on vesicle fusion; furthermore, but less important, former panel E of figure 5 could nicely be accommodated into the new figure 6 . Thus, we kept 5E in the main figures (now figure 6H ).Minor comment 11:' Fig. 6A : While interesting, the sketch could be moved to the supplements.'We completely agree and moved the panel to the supplement ( Figure S4A ).' Fig. 6G : Could be moved to the supplements'Some reasoning as above for Fig. 5E. Former figure 6G is now figure 8F.Minor comment 13:' Fig. 6E : While manual counting is certainly being used a lot, these assays could be alternatively quantified using flow cytometry to get data, which might be less biased by manual observation.'We agree that FACS would be a useful method for this type of assay. We would like to point out that counting was performed by a scientist blind to the conditions. This is now mentioned in the methods description. The effect size is considerable, so it appeared to us that the quantification method chosen is useful. In addition, there is no FACS in the BSL3 laboratory we are using. We were not allowed to export samples from the BSL3 to perform FACS analysis in an external core facility.Minor comment 14:' Fig. 7 A,B: Is there a correlation between autophagy induction and MERS-CoV inhibition?'In general, the compounds that are more effective in inducing autophagy are also more effective in MERS-CoV inhibition (now Figure 9A General comment: 'The extensive revisions in this manuscript add to the already large datasets that was included in the original version. The amount of data in this new version clearly separates between 2 stories. The authors identify how SKP2 effects BECN1 levels via ubiquitination and how inhibition of SKP2 by either siRNA or inhibitory compounds effect BECN1 and autophagy. The report then presents an entirely separate story, on the role of autophagy and MERS-CoV including live virus and how individual MERS-CoV proteins are shown to effect autophagy flux. It is unclear why these 2 stories are combined into this large of a paper and it diminishes the goal of making a clear and organized manuscript. The first story on SKP2 and Beclin1 are clear and direct while the second story on MERS-CoV and how it effects and is affected by autophagic machinery is still unfinished with data that is discordant with the text descriptions of it.'We agree that the manuscript might be lengthy and that separating it into two manuscripts might be an option, in principle. In conclusion, we think that the combination of data regarding the MERS-CoVdependent modulation of autophagy and the potential treatability of this virus by addressing the novel SKP2-autophagy pathway is highly beneficial for the manuscript.Specific comment 1:'The addition of the raw fold changes and PFU/ml are helpful in determining the effects of autophagy on MERS-CoV replication however the RNA and PFU levels do not correlate with each other. In the added figures of Figure 9B and the supplementary figures associated with it, the fold changes and raw PFU and genome numbers do not correlate with increases and decreases going in opposite directions. There is also no quantitation of significance in these figures making it difficult to interpret as described in the text.'The comment concerns figures 9B and S9A, which display the fold difference (9B) and the raw data (S9A) of the genome equivalents, as well as figures S9B and S9C, which display the fold difference (S9B) and the raw data (S9C) of the pfu measurements. We realized that there was a mistake in the column coloring for DMSO in Figure 9B which may have caused confusion. We apologize for this and corrected the colors. The DMSO black column (left) and gray column (right) were switched. In addition, we would like to emphasize that one has to compare all gray columns (24 hours post infection) and all black columns (48 hours post infection) separately. In Figure 9B the DMSO control was set to 1 for both time points and cannot directly be related to Figure S9A which shows the raw data in log scale. As growth differences are difficult to identify on a log scale we decided to show fold-change in relation to the DMSO control in Figure 9B . Since the presentation of the fold differences in Figures 9B and S9B are mathematical derivatives of the raw data displayed in Figures S9A and S9C The reviewer is completely right by saying that a direct comparison between GE/ml ( Figure S9A ) and PFU/ml (Figures S9C) shows some minor discrepancies for some of the compounds. This may be explained by interference of the respective compounds with the production of infectious viral particles which may subsequently influence the GE/ml to PFU/ml ratio. Mechanistic details of these minor discrepancies were not addressed and would be beyond the scope of this paper.Overall, however, as explained in our response to the first round of comments, the GE/ml and PFU/ml pattern is highly similar. We are now providing quantification of significance. In addition, we submit all raw data to these figures. The text claims significant differences however that is not evident in the calculations of the figures.'We are now providing quantification of significance. In addition, we submit all raw data to these figures in a data source file that covers all figures.Specific comment 3: 'The newly added TRAF6 control data requested in Figure 2 does not correlate with the graph presented. An initial concern for this figure is that ectopic TRAF6 was not included in the pulse chase experiments in Figure 2E and F. The authors have now added in the data showing TRAF6 ectopically expressed in this experiment. The text states, as well as the graph of the western blots, that TRAF6 ectopically expressed in the cells does not effect Beclin 1 levels. However the western blots associated with Figure 2E clearly show a stabilizing effect on Beclin1 protein levels, which does not correlate with the graph shown in Figure 2F . There does not seem to be a way to connect the western blot data with that graphed in Figure 2F . The data suggests that the ectopic expression of SKP2 shows beclin1 degradation at the same level as expression of TRAF6. This is not what is shown in the western blots. It is unclear how the graph could be made from the data provided in the figure.'Response: It appears to us that the reviewer's impression derives from a combination of our poor selection of the blot example and maybe screen display. We are now submitting less exposed blots to this figure, along with the quantification data of the individual blots in the data source file.Specific comment 4: 'The addition of Figure S2D in response to the question of whether the use of HBSS and BafA1 are inducing autophagic flux as expected is warranted. However again the quantification of the western blot and the images of the western blot are not the same. The graph suggests that the LC3II/I ratio is the same for HBSS and BafA1 treatment however the western blot does not show that same correlation. It is clear in the western blot provided that the 2 sets of data are not equal. While the western blot does show reduction of LC3II in HBSS treatment suggesting autophagic flux, the data do not correlate between the graph and the blot shown.'We agree that the western blot did not fully reflect the average given in the graph, partly due to, as we suspect, the higher abundance of LC3I in comparison to LC3II which makes it difficult to select blots that visualize differences in the two LC3 species equally well for the eye. As before, we are now submitting less exposed blots (new experiment) along with the raw data of the quantification. II to actin (or any other protein) would not change the numbers. While this is mentioned in the supplementary methods, we realized that we mentioned the Actin antibody, but failed to state that it was used for normalization. We are grateful for the hint and added a respective sentence in the supplement (page 23, last sentence).Minor point 4: 'Regardless of the availability of BSL3 space (which I agree can be a limiting factor), I still think that experiments in ATG5 KO cells need to be done, even though all hints and all evidence points towards autophagy and the MERS CoV phenotype being connected. However, this might be beyond the scope of this paper.'We agree on the usefulness of this experiment. We further adjusted our wording and mention this experiment for future work, also considering the comments of reviewer 1(discussion, page 29)."}, {"qas" : [{"question":"What is the structure of the virus?", "id": "0a1a26855aab1c04db731b54a25ac7108bd49884", "is_impossible": false}], "context" : "A population can be immune to epidemics even if not all of its individual members are immune to the disease, just as long as sufficiently many are immune-this is the traditional notion of herd immunity. In the smartphone era a population can be immune to epidemics even if not a single one of its members is immune to the disease-a notion we propose to call 'digital herd immunity', which is similarly an emergent characteristic of the population. This immunity arises because contact-tracing protocols based on smartphone capabilities can lead to highly efficient quarantining of infected population members and thus the extinguishing of nascent epidemics. When the disease characteristics are favorable and smartphone usage is high enough, the population is in this immune phase. As usage decreases there is a novel 'contact tracing' phase transition to an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for COVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the proportion of non-symptomatic transmission. We believe this is a promising strategy for dealing with COVID-19 in many countries such as India, whose challenges of scale motivated us to undertake this study in the first place and whose case we discuss briefly.Recent events have challenged the public health infrastructure worldwide for controlling the spread of contagious diseases. This difficulty is partly due to the novel pathogen involved and partly due to some unusual characteristics of COVID-19 [1] , which pose unique obstacles to developing a systematic public health response. Specifically, the infection appears to be transmitted through a large number of asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases and the fraction of such transmission is large enough to lead to an epidemic on its own, even if all symptomatic cases were immediately isolated [1, 2] . This leaves two approaches to controlling an exponential growth in the number of infected people. The first is continuous monitoring of entire populations via regular testing, which can identify new infections already during their latent phase and thus end non-symptomatic transmission. The second is the established method of 'contact tracing' [3] , in which people who have been exposed to newly identified infected people are isolated before they have a chance to infect others. In principle, either approach is capable of ending the epidemic.Population-level testing is not possible today, but perhaps with major advances in pooled testing this may be possible not too long from now, at least for populations in countries with the requisite health care infrastructure. Traditional contact tracing, done by teams of health officials relying on interviews with newly identified cases, is also not up to the task today, as it fails if non-symptomatic transmission is too frequent [3, 4] . Fortunately, we live in the smartphone era, and it has been noted that using these devices to record contacts can make the task of tracing them entirely solvable by automating it. This idea has been spelled out in a series of papers [5, 6] and is the basis for a rapidly expanding set of contact-tracing apps and the recent announcement by the Apple-Google duopoly of their intention to build the technology into their operating systems [7] . We note that the possibility of using mobile networks to study disease dynamics has been explored in the past [8] [9] [10] .In this paper we contribute to this emerging field of infectious disease control along two axes. First, we present a simple model of the early stages of the spread of COVID-19, which allows us to obtain estimates, as a function of a varying amount of non-symptomatic transmission, of the fraction of the population that needs to participate in a digital contact sharing network in order to prevent new epidemics. Our interest in this question was seeded by the very practical question of whether a country like India can use this technology to achieve epidemic control today. Indeed, India is now launched on this enterprise [11] . While somewhat more complex modeling with various differences from our own became available while we were working on this problem [5, 12] , we feel that our approach has the virtue of making the existence and values of the estimated compliance thresholds transparent. Our estimates for the fraction of the population that needs to own a contact-tracing app to avert a COVID-19 epidemic range from 75% − 95%, depending on the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, θ = 20% − 50%, that takes place. Busy epidemiologists and health officials will find this part of interest.Our second contribution is to frame the overall discussion in a language more familiar to physicists and students of complex phenomena more generally-that of phases, phase transitions and emergent properties. The bottom line here is the idea that the immunity of a population to epidemic growth is an emergent, or collective, property of the population. For traditional vaccination or epidemic-induced 'herd immunity', this feature gets conflated with the fact that individuals can be immune to the disease at issue. But mass digital contact tracing now makes it possible for the population to be immune to epidemic growth even as no individual has immunity to the underlying disease. We propose to refer to this as the existence of a 'digital herd immunity'. This fits well into the general idea of an emergent property, which does not exist at the level of the microscopic constituents but exists for the collective [13, 14] . We would be remiss if we did not note that epidemiologists have previously referred to this state of affairs as 'herd protection' and 'sustained epidemic control' [5] . Our intention with the proposed terminology is both to frame a public health goal by including the word digital and to emphasize the emergent nature of a herd immunity.In the balance of this paper we do the following. We begin by summarizing the case for contact tracing as an effective strategy for combating COVID-19. We then introduce a simple branching-process model for the spread of this disease, that incorporates the key features necessary to assess the efficacy of a digital, app-based approach, namely asymptomatic transmission, pre-symptomatic transmission and recursive contact tracing. We find in general that there is a critical fraction 0 ≤ φ c < 1 of app ownership, such that takeup of contact-tracing apps by a fraction φ > φ c of the population is sufficient to prevent epidemic spread. We provide an analytical, 'self-consistent mean-field' estimate for this threshold, which is verified against detailed numerical simulations. In the final discussion, we address the applicability of our results to the specific context of India.A. Motivation and relevance to COVID-19Traditional contact tracing is a multi-stage process. First, one identifies symptomatic, infected individuals. Next, one finds the people they came into close contact with during their infectious period. Finally, one treats or isolates these people before they can go on to infect others. Manual contact tracing becomes difficult for infections that have a period before the onset of symptoms when an exposed person is contagious (the Ω period). Further delay in finding the symptomatic person and their contacts could lead to tertiary infections, making it difficult to control an outbreak. For COVID-19, the incubation period is thought to be around 5-6 days, while the Ω period is estimated to be 1-3 days [2] . The time before becoming contagious, or the latent period L, is around 4 days. Stochasticity of these times aside, it is reasonable to expect that if Ω < L on average, and if the exposed contacts of an individual can be traced before they become infectious, then an epidemic could be prevented. However, the delays typical for manual contact tracing, even just one or two days, can render contact tracing completely ineffective for COVID-19, given the typical L and Ω periods; this conclusion is supported by detailed numerical simulations [5, 12] . This is where digital contact tracing comes in. A smartphone application could enable instant isolation of an infected person and their network of contacts. This halts the transmission chain, because infected contacts cannot infect others during their latent period. The question immediately arises of how widespread such tracing needs to be in order to prevent an epidemic, and this question is the focus of our paper. Below we present a simple model that captures the essential features of disease spread necessary to tackle this problem.To place our work in context, the classic quantitative analyses of the efficacy of contact tracing [3, 4] , from before the smartphone era, showed that traditional, manual contact-tracing protocols become useless when the rate of non-symptomatic spreading, θ, is too high. By contrast, app-based approaches allow for 'recursive' contact tracing, whereby contacts of contacts can be traced to an arbitrary recursive depth, at no additional cost. The effectiveness of recursive contact tracing has been studied in previous work; mathematically rigorous results exist for purely symptomatic transmission [15, 16] and detailed numerical simulations have been performed that take non-symptomatic transmission into account [17] . Some recent works have provided quantitative estimates for the effectiveness of contact-tracing, both non-recursive and recursive, in the specific context of COVID-19 [5, 6, 12] . Our results should be viewed as complementary to these studies. One comparative advantage of the model that we propose is its simplicity; in particular, it provides a natural starting point for understanding the universal properties of the contact-tracing phase transition.Suppose we have an epidemic spreading through an infinite population of susceptibles, in discrete time, and infecting a number R of the population at each time step (here, R is an 'effective reproduction number' that depends on the detailed properties of the epidemic spread, including the basic reproduction number R 0 ). This is a generic model for a spreading epidemic at short times. The total number of infections I tot scales asand if R < 1, the epidemic has been controlled. We want to understand which R best captures the effect of mobile-phone-based contact tracing. From a statistical physics perspective, R is the single relevant parameter controlling the epidemic spread, and the key question is which 'microscopic' degrees of freedom must be included to obtain a realistic estimate for R.To this end, we consider three parameters which implicitly determine R : the fraction of the population that will present asymptomatic cases (θ), the fraction of the population using a contact tracing application (φ), and the basic reproduction number for an individual who All rights reserved.

An illustrative realization of our branching-process model. a) An in-network asymptomatic person (CA) infects R0 = 3 people, whose category of infection is chosen independently and uniformly subject to parameters θ, the fraction of the population that presents asymptomatic cases, and φ, the fraction of the population using a contact-tracing app. b) A CS infection triggers an alert on the contact network, but the CS person and everybody else in their generation is still able to infect people before the contact network is triggered (while we depict RS = 2, we also simulate more realistic values RS = 0, 1). The arrows show the alerts sent to everyone connected to the CS individual by the contact network. c) Once the alert is sent out, everybody in the contact-networkconnected component of the CS individual can be quarantined immediately (thick circles) without giving rise to further disease spread, since they are in the latent (non-contagious) periods of their infections. Everyone outside the contact network continue to infect people as usual. The 'recursive' aspect of such contact tracing corresponds to the arrow going back in time in Fig. (1b) ; the middle branch of infections would be missed by a traditional, non-recursive approach.eventually shows symptoms (R S ). R S is a combined measure of the number of pre-symptomatic infections and the efficacy of quarantine: in the limit of perfect isolation after showing symptoms, R S is precisely the number of people that a symptomatic individual infects during their Ω period, as defined above. We assume that R S is independent of whether a symptomatic individual is on the contact-tracing network or not.The effects of these parameters on the growth of the epidemic (or R) are studied using a simple branchingprocess model, where all infectious individuals are either symptomatic (S) or asymptomatic (A), and either on the app-based contact tracing network (C) or not (N). In an an uncontrolled setting, all types of infectious cases are assumed to proliferate with R 0 = 3, which is a reasonable estimate [18] for COVID-19 1 . Suppose that the outbreak starts from a single infected individual at time t = 0. In our discrete time (generational) model, this person infects R 0 other people at time t = 1, and each new infection is allotted one of the categories {CA, CS, N A, N S} randomly, with probabilities that are determined by the values of θ and φ. Individuals infected at the beginning of each generation are assumed not to infect anyone else after that generation has elapsed. Whenever a symptomatic person on the contact network (CS) is encountered during this branching process, the contact network is triggered, and all people connected by the network through past and present infections are placed in quarantine. As discussed earlier, since pre-symptomatic infections are common for COVID-19, our model includes the possibility that a CS person infects R S people by the time they trigger the contact network. As a consequence, non-CS people in the same generation also infect the next generation before the activation of the contact network (see Fig. 1c ). A few time-steps of the model are illustrated explicitly in Fig. 1 , together with the implementation of recursive contact tracing via removing connected components of the contact graph. Different combinations of the parameters θ, φ and R S lead to an effective reproduction number R distinct from the bare reproduction number R 0 , and we expect epidemic growth to be suppressed whenever R < 1.Numerical simulations of this model were performed on 10, 000 nodes with 100 initial infections; the results are summarized in Fig. 2 . The location of the phase boundaries were verified to be independent of both doubling the system size and doubling the number of samples averaged per point shown on the phase diagram, to within the resolution of the phase diagram. Our numerics are consistent with the hypothesis that for any given fraction of asymptomatic transmission 0 ≤ θ < 1, and any presymptomatic reproduction number 0 ≤ R S ≤ R 0 , there is a critical point φ c (θ), corresponding to the onset of 'digital herd immunity': epidemic control occurs for a fraction of app owners φ c (θ) < φ ≤ 1. For realistic COVID-19 parameter values, R 0 = 3, R S = 1 and θ = 0.2 − 0.5 [5, 18] , we find that φ c (θ) = 75% − 95%, illustrating that when both presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission are taken into account, the rate of app coverage necessary to prevent an epidemic can be rather high. Some practical implications of this point are raised in the final discussion. 1 There are also some higher estimates in the literature, e.g. based on the early epidemic dynamics in Wuhan [19] . Given the greatly increased state of awareness of the disease at this point it seems reasonable to assume that such higher values are not relevant to disease dynamics today.All rights reserved.

RS denotes the basic reproduction number for pre-symptomatic transmission. Each phase diagram was generated from 4000 microscopic simulations of 20 generations of disease evolution on 10, 000 nodes, of which 100 nodes were initially infected at random. A black square denotes epidemic control (average growth in the cumulative number of infections over the generations 16 − 20 is less than 0.25% of total population). This is grayscaled continuously to white for late-time growth exceeding 2.5% per generation or full epidemic spread before 20 generations have elapsed. Dashed red curves denote the mean-field approximation to the phase boundary, θ = θc(φ) derived in Sec. II C. The exact critical point for θ = 0 and RS = 2, derived in Appendix A, is marked by a cyan arrow. Bottom: Sample simulations from the encircled region in the RS = 0 phase diagram. Curves (solid) denote cumulative number of infections as a percentage of total population, averaged over 10 samples (dashed), with θ = 0.5 fixed and φ varied from φ = 0.6 to φ = 0.9.To understand the connection between our model and the theory of phase transitions, it it helpful to consider the limit of no contact tracing, i.e. φ = 0, and no pre-symptomatic transmission, R S = 0. In this case, symptomatic individuals act as though they were immune, since they cannot transmit the infection further. Along the line φ = 0, the model exhibits a transition from an 'immune phase' to an 'epidemic phase' for θ ≥ θ c = 1/R 0 , as shown in Fig. 2 . In fact, when φ = 0 and R S = 0, our model maps exactly to site percolation on a Bethe lattice with coordination number z = 1 + R 0 , where 'site percolation' is equivalent to the existence of an infinite cluster of asymptomatic infections. The connection between simple epidemic models and percolation transitions has been noted in the past [20, 21] .By contrast, the non-local structure of recursive contact tracing, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , suggests that the universality class of the immune-to-epidemic transition for φ > 0 is distinct from standard site percolation. Nevertheless, in Appendix A we show that for a population without asymptomatic infections (the line θ = 0 in our phase diagram), we can obtain the critical fraction φ c of app usage exactly, for general values of R 0 , such that an epidemic occurs for φ ≤ φ c and is suppressed for φ > φ c . The calculation proceeds by self-consistently estimating the probability of formation of infinitely long chains of infections, mirroring the standard techniques of percolation theory [22] . In the presence of a finite fraction of asymptomatic people (θ = 0), we rely on a mean-field estimate for the location of the critical line (φ, θ c (φ)) as a function of R S ; detailed studies of the exact location of critical line and the universal features of the contacttracing phase transition are left to future work.To derive a 'mean-field' description of our model, let us label the possible states of an infected individual by α ∈ {CA, CS, N A, N S}. The probability that an initial infectious node i is in state α is denoted P(i = α). According to their respective fractions in the population, we haveSuppose now that the node i = α is infectious at time t = 0 and adjacent to a susceptible node j. The probability of epidemic spread is determined by the probability of transmission from the node i = α to j and onwards, which we denote p α . This can be approximated aswhere P(j = β|i = α) denotes the probability that node j is infectious and in state β at time t = 1, given that the node i was in state α at time t = 0, and we make a 'meanfield' approximation whereby only two-node processes are taken into account. The latter clearly breaks down when recursive contact tracing is taken into account, a point that we shall return to below. In terms of these probabilities p α and the basic reproduction numbers for the various states R α , the effective reproduction number in our mean-field approximation is given byAll rights reserved.

Throughout this section we assume R CA = R N A = R 0 and R CS = R N S = R S .Let us first consider transmission by individuals off the contact network. Since such individuals can transmit the disease freely, we have simplyMoving on to symptomatic individuals on the contact network (CS), we obtain the following conditional probabilities:which reflects the fact that on-network transmission from symptomatic individuals cannot generate transmission beyond node j (c.f. Fig. 1 ). Then, using Eqs. (2), (3) and (6), we findFinally, we consider asymptomatic infections on the contact network (CA). While the probabilities of transmitting infection outside the contact network are the same as Eq. (6), the transmission probabilities within the contact network are undetermined at the level of meanfield theory. As a first approximation, we can introduce variational parameters 0 ≤ γ 1 , γ 2 ≤ 1 which interpolate between 'best' and 'worst' cases for epidemic control, to witIn the 'best' case, γ 1 = γ 2 = 0, asymptomatic transmission within the network is completely suppressed, i.e. P(j = CA | i = CA) = P(j = CS | i = CA) = 0. In the 'worst' case, γ 1 = γ 2 = 1, asymptomatic transmission within the network is not suppressed at all, and P(j =proportional to the population fraction of the respective states. In these limits, we obtainWhile this provides some useful rules-of-thumb, there is seemingly no consistent way to fix the variational parameters γ 1 and γ 2 within this approach. Since the best approximation is likely to lie in between these extreme limits, we consider a naïve linear interpolation and setWe can fix the variational parameter γ self-consistently by noting that the critical line on the φ − θ phase diagram ought to pass through the point (φ = 1, θ = 1), since there is an epidemic for {φ < 1, θ = 1}, when the population is entirely asymptomatic but not entirely on the contact network, and no epidemic for {φ = 1, θ < 1}, when the population is entirely on the contact network but not entirely asymptomatic. We find that setting γ = 1 − 1/R 0 ensures this condition, and thus obtain the following estimate for the effective reproduction number:An alternative approach is to derive a self-consistent estimate for p CA directly, by explicitly taking into account some of the higher-order, multi-node processes of transmission. The key observation is that an infectious node i = CA can infect a susceptible neighbour j in only three ways that allow for continued transmission; either infection is transmitted directly off the contact network, i → j ∈ {N A, N S}, infection is transmitted off the contact network via a pre-symptomatic, on-network intermediary, i → j = CS → k ∈ {N A, N S}, or transmission is perpetuated by another asymptomatic node j ∈ CA on the contact network. To account for these three possibilities, we can write down a self-consistent equation for p CA ,which yieldsThe approximations of Eqs. (5), (7) , and (13) then implyThe critical thresholds R = 1 predicted by Eqs. (11) and (14) are almost indistinguishable on the phase diagrams with R 0 = 3. In Fig. 2 we show the critical curves predicted by Eq. (14) and find good agreement with numerical simulations.These mean-field approaches therefore capture the approximate location of the critical curve (φ, θ c (φ)) (equivalently (φ c (θ), θ)), and thus the essential qualitative features of recursive contact tracing with non-symptomatic transmission.We have introduced a simple branching-process model for early-stage epidemic spread, which both retains a degree of analytical and numerical tractability and is All rights reserved.

Using this model we obtained predictions for realistic COVID-19 parameter values, finding that in order for a contact-tracing app to be effective, the fraction of app take-up among a given population would need to lie between 75% and 95%, depending on the frequency of asymptomatic transmission.We now consider the practical applicability of our results to India, whose particular challenges provided the initial stimulus for this work. At first sight, India's overall smartphone coverage of around 40% [23] suggests that it might be difficult to attain 'digital herd immunity' using solely app-based contact tracing [11] . However, smartphone-based measures could be combined with other tracing efforts to compensate for the limited availability of smartphones. Specifically, more traditional interview methods can still be used to reconstruct the location history of a newly diagnosed person. Systematic, random testing might also help in this regard [24] . As almost 90% [23] of Indians use some sort of wireless phone, alerts from people on the app-based network as well as interview-based alerts could be broadcast via SMS and combined with cell tower triangulation for spatial resolution in addition to the temporal resolution that would already be available. Major metropolitan areas, which include a number of COVID-19 hot-spots [25] , would be particularly well-suited to such a dual approach, since they exhibit both higher smartphone coverage and a higher density of cell-phone towers, allowing for more accurate triangulation [26] . Finally, it seems entirely possible to boost smartphone ownership for this purpose by the use of donated used phones and subsidized data provided to run the contact tracing app.Several natural questions arise for future work. From a practical standpoint, one worthwhile extension of our model would be to allow for a degree of stochasticity in the basic reproduction number R 0 , for example, by simulating the branching-process model on small-world networks with varying degree per node, which are known to better reflect realistic human contact networks [27, 28] than networks with fixed degree. Indeed, network structure has previously been shown to influence the effectiveness of contact tracing [4, [29] [30] [31] . Meanwhile, an important open problem from the perspective of statistical physics is pinning down the universality class of the contact-tracing transition. Our study of the critical point along the line θ = 0 indicates that techniques from percolation theory are likely to be useful; on the other hand, the non-local character of recursive contact tracing distinguishes it from the percolation transitions that have arisen in related applications [20, 21, 32, 33] , and suggests that the critical exponents at the transition point differ from those of standard site percolation, even on the Bethe lattice. We leave a detailed exploration of these fascinating questions to subsequent studies.Solving Eqs. (A2) and (A3) simultaneously, we obtain the critical point φ = φ c , such that p N = p C = 0 for φ > φ c . We now illustrate the computation of φ c for a general R 0 = R. The probabilities p N and p C for this case can be written analogously to Eqs. (A2) and (A3) asSubstituting Eq. (A5) in Eq. (A4), and using f C + f N = 1, we obtainExcluding the p N = 0 solution, we can simplify Eq. (A6) to readwhere we have used O(p N ) to denote a polynomial in p N with all terms having degree greater than or equal to 1.Since the critical fraction φ c for a phase transition occurs at p N = 0, we substitute p N = 0, and the fractions f N and f C in Eq. (A7) to obtainwhere we have chosen the physical solution such that 0 ≤ φ c ≤ 1. This result matches our numerical phase diagram to within the resolution of the plot, improving upon the mean-field prediction of the main text; see Fig. 2 for an example with R = 2."}]}]}
